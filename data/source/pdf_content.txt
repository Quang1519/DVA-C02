QUESTION 1
A company is implementing an application on Amazon EC2 instances. The application needs to
process incoming transactions. When the application detects a transaction that is not valid, the
application must send a chat message to the company's support team. To send the message, the
application needs to retrieve the access token to authenticate by using the chat API.
A developer needs to implement a solution to store the access token. The access token must be
encrypted at rest and in transit. The access token must also be accessible from other AWS accounts.
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST management overhead?
A. Use an AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store SecureString parameter that uses an AWS Key
Management Service (AWS KMS) AWS managed key to store the access token. Add a resource-based
policy to the parameter to allow access from other accounts. Update the IAM role of the EC2
instances with permissions to access Parameter Store. Retrieve the token from Parameter Store with
the decrypt flag enabled. Use the decrypted access token to send the message to the chat.
B. Encrypt the access token by using an AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer
managed key. Store the access token in an Amazon DynamoDB table. Update the IAM role of the EC2
instances with permissions to access DynamoDB and AWS KMS. Retrieve the token from DynamoDB.
Decrypt the token by using AWS KMS on the EC2 instances. Use the decrypted access token to send
the message to the chat.
C. Use AWS Secrets Manager with an AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer managed
key to store the access token. Add a resource-based policy to the secret to allow access from other
accounts. Update the IAM role of the EC2 instances with permissions to access Secrets Manager.
Retrieve the token from Secrets Manager. Use the decrypted access token to send the message to
the chat.
D. Encrypt the access token by using an AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) AWS managed
key. Store the access token in an Amazon S3 bucket. Add a bucket policy to the S3 bucket to allow
access from other accounts. Update the IAM role of the EC2 instances with permissions to access
Amazon S3 and AWS KMS. Retrieve the token from the S3 bucket. Decrypt the token by using AWS
KMS on the EC2 instances. Use the decrypted access token to send the massage to the chat.

QUESTION 2
A company is running Amazon EC2 instances in multiple AWS accounts. A developer needs to
implement an application that collects all the lifecycle events of the EC2 instances. The application
needs to store the lifecycle events in a single Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue in

the company's main AWS account for further processing.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A. Configure Amazon EC2 to deliver the EC2 instance lifecycle events from all accounts to the Amazon
EventBridge event bus of the main account. Add an EventBridge rule to the event bus of the main
account that matches all EC2 instance lifecycle events. Add the SQS queue as a target of the rule.
B. Use the resource policies of the SQS queue in the main account to give each account permissions
to write to that SQS queue. Add to the Amazon EventBridge event bus of each account an
EventBridge rule that matches all EC2 instance lifecycle events. Add the SQS queue in the main
account as a target of the rule.
C. Write an AWS Lambda function that scans through all EC2 instances in the company accounts to
detect EC2 instance lifecycle changes. Configure the Lambda function to write a notification message
to the SQS queue in the main account if the function detects an EC2 instance lifecycle change. Add an
Amazon EventBridge scheduled rule that invokes the Lambda function every minute.
D. Configure the permissions on the main account event bus to receive events from all accounts.
Create an Amazon EventBridge rule in each account to send all the EC2 instance lifecycle events to
the main account event bus. Add an EventBridge rule to the main account event bus that matches all
EC2 instance lifecycle events. Set the SQS queue as a target for the rule.
Answer: D
Explanation:
Amazon EC2 instances can send the state-change notification events to Amazon EventBridge.

when launching the CloudFormation stack, but only from the approved list.
QUESTION 7
A developer has an application that makes batch requests directly to Amazon DynamoDB by using
the BatchGetItem low-level API operation. The responses frequently return values in the
UnprocessedKeys element.
Which actions should the developer take to increase the resiliency of the application when the batch
response includes values in UnprocessedKeys? (Choose two.)
A. Retry the batch operation immediately.
B. Retry the batch operation with exponential backoff and randomized delay.
C. Update the application to use an AWS software development kit (AWS SDK) to make the requests.
D. Increase the provisioned read capacity of the DynamoDB tables that the operation accesses.
E. Increase the provisioned write capacity of the DynamoDB tables that the operation accesses.
Answer: B, C
Explanation:

The UnprocessedKeys element indicates that the BatchGetItem operation did not process all of the
requested items in the current response. This can happen if the response size limit is exceeded or if
the tables provisioned throughput is exceeded. To handle this situation, the developer should retry
the batch operation with exponential backoff and randomized delay to avoid throttling errors and
reduce the load on the table. The developer should also use an AWS SDK to make the requests, as
the SDKs automatically retry requests that return UnprocessedKeys.

QUESTION 8
A company is running a custom application on a set of on-premises Linux servers that are accessed
using Amazon API Gateway. AWS X-Ray tracing has been enabled on the API test stage.
How can a developer enable X-Ray tracing on the on-premises servers with the LEAST amount of
configuration?
A. Install and run the X-Ray SDK on the on-premises servers to capture and relay the data to the XRay
service.
B. Install and run the X-Ray daemon on the on-premises servers to capture and relay the data to the
X-Ray service.
C. Capture incoming requests on-premises and configure an AWS Lambda function to pull, process,
and relay relevant data to X-Ray using the PutTraceSegments API call.
D. Capture incoming requests on-premises and configure an AWS Lambda function to pull, process,
and relay relevant data to X-Ray using the PutTelemetryRecords API call.
Answer: B
Explanation:
The X-Ray daemon is a software that collects trace data from the X-Ray SDK and relays it to the X-Ray
service. The X-Ray daemon can run on any platform that supports Go, including Linux, Windows, and
macOS. The developer can install and run the X-Ray daemon on the on-premises servers to capture
and relay the data to the X-Ray service with minimal configuration. The X-Ray SDK is used to
instrument the application code, not to capture and relay data. The Lambda function solutions are
more complex and require additional configuration.

QUESTION 9
A company wants to share information with a third party. The third party has an HTTP API endpoint
that the company can use to share the information. The company has the required API key to access

the HTTP API.
The company needs a way to manage the API key by using code. The integration of the API key with
the application code cannot affect application performance.
Which solution will meet these requirements MOST securely?
A. Store the API credentials in AWS Secrets Manager. Retrieve the API credentials at runtime by using
the AWS SDK. Use the credentials to make the API call.
B. Store the API credentials in a local code variable. Push the code to a secure Git repository. Use the
local code variable at runtime to make the API call.
C. Store the API credentials as an object in a private Amazon S3 bucket. Restrict access to the S3
object by using IAM policies. Retrieve the API credentials at runtime by using the AWS SDK. Use the
credentials to make the API call.
D. Store the API credentials in an Amazon DynamoDB table. Restrict access to the table by using
resource-based policies. Retrieve the API credentials at runtime by using the AWS SDK. Use the
credentials to make the API call.
Answer: A
Explanation:
AWS Secrets Manager is a service that helps securely store, rotate, and manage secrets such as API
keys, passwords, and tokens. The developer can store the API credentials in AWS Secrets Manager
and retrieve them at runtime by using the AWS SDK. This solution will meet the requirements of
security, code management, and performance. Storing the API credentials in a local code variable or
an S3 object is not secure, as it exposes the credentials to unauthorized access or leakage. Storing the
API credentials in a DynamoDB table is also not secure, as it requires additional encryption and
access control measures. Moreover, retrieving the credentials from S3 or DynamoDB may affect
application performance due to network latency.

QUESTION 12
A developer is creating an application that will give users the ability to store photos from their
cellphones in the cloud. The application needs to support tens of thousands of users. The application
uses an Amazon API Gateway REST API that is integrated with AWS Lambda functions to process the
photos. The application stores details about the photos in Amazon DynamoDB.
Users need to create an account to access the application. In the application, users must be able to
upload photos and retrieve previously uploaded photos. The photos will range in size from 300 KB to
5 MB.
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?
A. Use Amazon Cognito user pools to manage user accounts. Create an Amazon Cognito user pool
authorizer in API Gateway to control access to the API. Use the Lambda function to store the photos
and details in the DynamoDB table. Retrieve previously uploaded photos directly from the
DynamoDB table.

QUESTION 13
A company receives food orders from multiple partners. The company has a microservices
application that uses Amazon API Gateway APIs with AWS Lambda integration. Each partner sends
orders by calling a customized API that is exposed through API Gateway. The API call invokes a shared
Lambda function to process the orders.
Partners need to be notified after the Lambda function processes the orders. Each partner must
receive updates for only the partner's own orders. The company wants to add new partners in the
future with the fewest code changes possible.
Which solution will meet these requirements in the MOST scalable way?
A. Create a different Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic for each partner.
Configure the Lambda function to publish messages for each partner to the partner's SNS topic.
B. Create a different Lambda function for each partner. Configure the Lambda function to notify each
partner's service endpoint directly.
C. Create an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic. Configure the Lambda function
to publish messages with specific attributes to the SNS topic. Subscribe each partner to the SNS
topic. Apply the appropriate filter policy to the topic subscriptions.
D. Create one Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic. Subscribe all partners to the
SNS topic.
Answer: C
Explanation:
Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) is a fully managed messaging service that enables
pub/sub communication between distributed systems. The developer can create an SNS topic and
configure the Lambda function to publish messages with specific attributes to the topic. The
developer can subscribe each partner to the SNS topic and apply the appropriate filter policy to the
topic subscriptions. This way, each partner will receive updates for only their own orders based on

the message attributes. This solution will meet the requirements in the most scalable way and allow
adding new partners in the future with minimal code changes.

QUESTION 14
A financial company must store original customer records for 10 years for legal reasons. A complete
record contains personally identifiable information (PII). According to local regulations, PII is
available to only certain people in the company and must not be shared with third parties. The
company needs to make the records available to third-party organizations for statistical analysis
without sharing the PII.
A developer wants to store the original immutable record in Amazon S3. Depending on who accesses
the S3 document, the document should be returned as is or with all the PII removed. The developer
has written an AWS Lambda function to remove the PII from the document. The function is named
removePii.
What should the developer do so that the company can meet the PII requirements while maintaining
only one copy of the document?
A. Set up an S3 event notification that invokes the removePii function when an S3 GET request is
made. Call Amazon S3 by using a GET request to access the object without PII.
B. Set up an S3 event notification that invokes the removePii function when an S3 PUT request is
made. Call Amazon S3 by using a PUT request to access the object without PII.
C. Create an S3 Object Lambda access point from the S3 console. Select the removePii function. Use
S3 Access Points to access the object without PII.
D. Create an S3 access point from the S3 console. Use the access point name to call the
GetObjectLegalHold S3 API function. Pass in the removePii function name to access the object
without PII.
Answer: C
Explanation:
S3 Object Lambda allows you to add your own code to process data retrieved from S3 before
returning it to an application. You can use an AWS Lambda function to modify the data, such as
removing PII, redacting confidential information, or resizing images. You can create an S3 Object
Lambda access point and associate it with your Lambda function. Then, you can use the access point
to request objects from S3 and get the modified data back. This way, you can maintain only one copy
of the original document in S3 and apply different transformations depending on who accesses it.

QUESTION 15
A developer is deploying an AWS Lambda function The developer wants the ability to return to older

versions of the function quickly and seamlessly.
How can the developer achieve this goal with the LEAST operational overhead?
A. Use AWS OpsWorks to perform blue/green deployments.
B. Use a function alias with different versions.
C. Maintain deployment packages for older versions in Amazon S3.
D. Use AWS CodePipeline for deployments and rollbacks.
Answer: B
Explanation:
A function alias is a pointer to a specific Lambda function version. You can use aliases to create
different environments for your function, such as development, testing, and production. You can also
use aliases to perform blue/green deployments by shifting traffic between two versions of your
function gradually. This way, you can easily roll back to a previous version if something goes wrong,
without having to redeploy your code or change your configuration. Reference: AWS Lambda
function aliases
QUESTION 16
A developer has written an AWS Lambda function. The function is CPU-bound. The developer wants
to ensure that the function returns responses quickly.
How can the developer improve the function's performance?
A. Increase the function's CPU core count.
B. Increase the function's memory.
C. Increase the function's reserved concurrency.
D. Increase the function's timeout.
Answer: B
Explanation:
The amount of memory you allocate to your Lambda function also determines how much CPU and
network bandwidth it gets. Increasing the memory size can improve the performance of CPU-bound
functions by giving them more CPU power. The CPU allocation is proportional to the memory
allocation, so a function with 1 GB of memory has twice the CPU power of a function with 512 MB of
memory. Reference: AWS Lambda execution environment
QUESTION 17

deployments?
A. BeforeInstall -> ApplicationStop -> ApplicationStart -> AfterInstall

B. ApplicationStop -> BeforeInstall -> AfterInstall -> ApplicationStart
C. BeforeInstall -> ApplicationStop -> ValidateService -> ApplicationStart
D. ApplicationStop -> BeforeInstall -> ValidateService -> ApplicationStart
Answer: B
Explanation:
For in-place deployments, AWS CodeDeploy uses a set of predefined hooks that run in a specific
order during each deployment lifecycle event. The hooks are ApplicationStop, BeforeInstall,
AfterInstall, ApplicationStart, and ValidateService. The run order of the hooks for in-place
deployments is as follows:
ApplicationStop: This hook runs first on all instances and stops the current application that is running
on the instances.
BeforeInstall: This hook runs after ApplicationStop on all instances and performs any tasks required
before installing the new application revision.
AfterInstall: This hook runs after BeforeInstall on all instances and performs any tasks required after
installing the new application revision.
ApplicationStart: This hook runs after AfterInstall on all instances and starts the new application that
has been installed on the instances.
ValidateService: This hook runs last on all instances and verifies that the new application is running
properly on the instances.

QUESTION 20
A developer wants to store information about movies. Each movie has a title, release year, and
genre. The movie information also can include additional properties about the cast and production
crew. This additional information is inconsistent across movies. For example, one movie might have
an assistant director, and another movie might have an animal trainer.
The developer needs to implement a solution to support the following use cases:
For a given title and release year, get all details about the movie that has that title and release year.
For a given title, get all details about all movies that have that title.
For a given genre, get all details about all movies in that genre.
Which data store configuration will meet these requirements?
A. Create an Amazon DynamoDB table. Configure the table with a primary key that consists of the
title as the partition key and the release year as the sort key. Create a global secondary index that
uses the genre as the partition key and the title as the sort key.
B. Create an Amazon DynamoDB table. Configure the table with a primary key that consists of the
genre as the partition key and the release year as the sort key. Create a global secondary index that
uses the title as the partition key.
C. On an Amazon RDS DB instance, create a table that contains columns for title, release year, and
genre. Configure the title as the primary key.
D. On an Amazon RDS DB instance, create a table where the primary key is the title and all other data
is encoded into JSON format as one additional column.
Answer: A
Explanation:
Amazon DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service that provides fast and consistent
performance with seamless scalability. The developer can create a DynamoDB table and configure
the table with a primary key that consists of the title as the partition key and the release year as the
sort key. This will enable querying for a given title and release year efficiently. The developer can also
create a global secondary index that uses the genre as the partition key and the title as the sort key.
This will enable querying for a given genre efficiently. The developer can store additional properties
about the cast and production crew as attributes in the DynamoDB table. These attributes can have
different data types and structures, and they do not need to be consistent across items.

QUESTION 25
A company is migrating an on-premises database to Amazon RDS for MySQL. The company has readheavy
workloads. The company wants to refactor the code to achieve optimum read performance for
queries.
Which solution will meet this requirement with LEAST current and future effort?

A. Use a multi-AZ Amazon RDS deployment. Increase the number of connections that the code
makes to the database or increase the connection pool size if a connection pool is in use.
B. Use a multi-AZ Amazon RDS deployment. Modify the code so that queries access the secondary
RDS instance.
C. Deploy Amazon RDS with one or more read replicas. Modify the application code so that queries
use the URL for the read replicas.
D. Use open source replication software to create a copy of the MySQL database on an Amazon EC2
instance. Modify the application code so that queries use the IP address of the EC2 instance.
Answer: C
Explanation:
Amazon RDS for MySQL supports read replicas, which are copies of the primary database instance
that can handle read-only queries. Read replicas can improve the read performance of the database
by offloading the read workload from the primary instance and distributing it across multiple
replicas. To use read replicas, the application code needs to be modified to direct read queries to the
URL of the read replicas, while write queries still go to the URL of the primary instance. This solution
requires less current and future effort than using a multi-AZ deployment, which does not provide
read scaling benefits, or using open source replication software, which requires additional
configuration and maintenance. Reference: Working with read replicas
QUESTION 26
A developer is creating an application that will be deployed on IoT devices. The application will send
data to a RESTful API that is deployed as an AWS Lambda function. The application will assign each
API request a unique identifier. The volume of API requests from the application can randomly
increase at any given time of day.
During periods of request throttling, the application might need to retry requests. The API must be
able to handle duplicate requests without inconsistencies or data loss.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A. Create an Amazon RDS for MySQL DB instance. Store the unique identifier for each request in a
database table. Modify the Lambda function to check the table for the identifier before processing
the request.
B. Create an Amazon DynamoDB table. Store the unique identifier for each request in the table.
Modify the Lambda function to check the table for the identifier before processing the request.
C. Create an Amazon DynamoDB table. Store the unique identifier for each request in the table.
Modify the Lambda function to return a client error response when the function receives a duplicate
request.
D. Create an Amazon ElastiCache for Memcached instance. Store the unique identifier for each
request in the cache. Modify the Lambda function to check the cache for the identifier before
processing the request.

Answer: B
Explanation:
Amazon DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service that can store and retrieve any
amount of data with high availability and performance. DynamoDB can handle concurrent requests
from multiple IoT devices without throttling or data loss. To prevent duplicate requests from causing
inconsistencies or data loss, the Lambda function can use DynamoDB conditional writes to check if
the unique identifier for each request already exists in the table before processing the request. If the
identifier exists, the function can skip or abort the request; otherwise, it can process the request and
store the identifier in the table. Reference: Using conditional writes
QUESTION 27
A developer wants to expand an application to run in multiple AWS Regions. The developer wants to
copy Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) with the latest changes and create a new application stack in
the destination Region. According to company requirements, all AMIs must be encrypted in all
Regions. However, not all the AMIs that the company uses are encrypted.
How can the developer expand the application to run in the destination Region while meeting the
encryption requirement?
A. Create new AMIs, and specify encryption parameters. Copy the encrypted AMIs to the destination
Region. Delete the unencrypted AMIs.
B. Use AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) to enable encryption on the unencrypted AMIs.
Copy the encrypted AMIs to the destination Region.
C. Use AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) to enable encryption on the unencrypted AMIs. Copy the
encrypted AMIs to the destination Region.
D. Copy the unencrypted AMIs to the destination Region. Enable encryption by default in the
destination Region.
Answer: A
Explanation:
Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) are encrypted snapshots of EC2 instances that can be used to launch
new instances. The developer can create new AMIs from the existing instances and specify
encryption parameters. The developer can copy the encrypted AMIs to the destination Region and
use them to create a new application stack. The developer can delete the unencrypted AMIs after
the encryption process is complete. This solution will meet the encryption requirement and allow
the developer to expand the application to run in the destination Region.

QUESTION 28
A company hosts a client-side web application for one of its subsidiaries on Amazon S3. The web
application can be accessed through Amazon CloudFront from https://www.example.com. After a
successful rollout, the company wants to host three more client-side web applications for its
remaining subsidiaries on three separate S3 buckets.
To achieve this goal, a developer moves all the common JavaScript files and web fonts to a central S3
bucket that serves the web applications. However, during testing, the developer notices that the
browser blocks the JavaScript files and web fonts.
What should the developer do to prevent the browser from blocking the JavaScript files and web
fonts?
A. Create four access points that allow access to the central S3 bucket. Assign an access point to each
web application bucket.
B. Create a bucket policy that allows access to the central S3 bucket. Attach the bucket policy to the
central S3 bucket.

QUESTION 29
An application is processing clickstream data using Amazon Kinesis. The clickstream data feed into
Kinesis experiences periodic spikes. The PutRecords API call occasionally fails and the logs show that
the failed call returns the response shown below:

Which techniques will help mitigate this exception? (Choose two.)
A. Implement retries with exponential backoff.
B. Use a PutRecord API instead of PutRecords.
C. Reduce the frequency and/or size of the requests.
D. Use Amazon SNS instead of Kinesis.
E. Reduce the number of KCL consumers.
Answer: AC
Explanation:
The response from the API call indicates that the ProvisionedThroughputExceededException
exception has occurred. This exception means that the rate of incoming requests exceeds the
throughput limit for one or more shards in a stream. To mitigate this exception, the developer can
use one or more of the following techniques:
Implement retries with exponential backoff. This will introduce randomness in the retry intervals and
avoid overwhelming the shards with retries.
Reduce the frequency and/or size of the requests. This will reduce the load on the shards and avoid
throttling errors.

Increase the number of shards in the stream. This will increase the throughput capacity of the stream
and accommodate higher request rates.
Use a PutRecord API instead of PutRecords. This will reduce the number of records per request and
avoid exceeding the payload limit.

in.
What is the MOST operationally efficient solution that meets this requirement?
A. Create an AWS Lambda function that uses Amazon Simple Email Service (Amazon SES) to send the
email notification. Add an Amazon API Gateway API to invoke the function. Call the API from the
client side when login confirmation is received.
B. Create an AWS Lambda function that uses Amazon Simple Email Service (Amazon SES) to send the
email notification. Add an Amazon Cognito post authentication Lambda trigger for the function.
C. Create an AWS Lambda function that uses Amazon Simple Email Service (Amazon SES) to send the
email notification. Create an Amazon CloudWatch Logs log subscription filter to invoke the function
based on the login status.
D. Configure Amazon Cognito to stream all logs to Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose. Create an AWS
Lambda function to process the streamed logs and to send the email notification based on the login
status of each user.
Answer: B
Explanation:
Amazon Cognito user pools support Lambda triggers, which are custom functions that can be
executed at various stages of the user pool workflow. A post authentication Lambda trigger can be
used to perform custom actions after a user is authenticated, such as sending an email notification.
Amazon SES is a cloud-based email sending service that can be used to send transactional or
marketing emails. A Lambda function can use the Amazon SES API to send an email to the users
email address after the user logs in successfully. Reference: Post authentication Lambda trigger
QUESTION 31
A developer has an application that stores data in an Amazon S3 bucket. The application uses an
HTTP API to store and retrieve objects. When the PutObject API operation adds objects to the S3
bucket the developer must encrypt these objects at rest by using server-side encryption with

Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3).
Which solution will meet this requirement?
A. Create an AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) key. Assign the KMS key to the S3 bucket.
B. Set the x-amz-server-side-encryption header when invoking the PutObject API operation.
C. Provide the encryption key in the HTTP header of every request.
D. Apply TLS to encrypt the traffic to the S3 bucket.
Answer: B
Explanation:
Amazon S3 supports server-side encryption, which encrypts data at rest on the server that stores the
data. One of the encryption options is SSE-S3, which uses keys managed by S3. To use SSE-S3, the xamz-
server-side-encryption header must be set to AES256 when invoking the PutObject API
operation. This instructs S3 to encrypt the object data with SSE-S3 before saving it on disks in its data
centers and decrypt it when it is downloaded. Reference: Protecting data using server-side
encryption with Amazon S3-managed encryption keys (SSE-S3)
QUESTION 32

A. Create and deploy an AWS Lambda function in each desired Region. Configure the Lambda
function to create a stack from an AWS CloudFormation template in that Region when the function is
invoked.
B. Create an AWS CloudFormation template that defines the load test resources. Use the AWS CLI
create-stack-set command to create a stack set in the desired Regions.
C. Create an AWS Systems Manager document that defines the resources. Use the document to
create the resources in the desired Regions.
D. Create an AWS CloudFormation template that defines the load test resources. Use the AWS CLI
deploy command to create a stack from the template in each Region.
Answer: B
Explanation:
AWS CloudFormation is a service that allows developers to model and provision AWS resources using
templates. A CloudFormation template can define the load test resources, such as EC2 instances,
load balancers, and Auto Scaling groups. A CloudFormation stack set is a collection of stacks that can
be created and managed from a single template in multiple Regions and accounts. The AWS CLI
create-stack-set command can be used to create a stack set from a template and specify the Regions
where the stacks should be created. Reference: Working with AWS CloudFormation stack sets

QUESTION 33
A developer is creating an application that includes an Amazon API Gateway REST API in the us-east-
2 Region. The developer wants to use Amazon CloudFront and a custom domain name for the API.
The developer has acquired an SSL/TLS certificate for the domain from a third-party provider.
How should the developer configure the custom domain for the application?
A. Import the SSL/TLS certificate into AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) in the same Region as the API.
Create a DNS A record for the custom domain.
B. Import the SSL/TLS certificate into CloudFront. Create a DNS CNAME record for the custom
domain.
C. Import the SSL/TLS certificate into AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) in the same Region as the API.
Create a DNS CNAME record for the custom domain.
D. Import the SSL/TLS certificate into AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) in the us-east-1 Region. Create
a DNS CNAME record for the custom domain.
Answer: D
Explanation:
Amazon API Gateway is a service that enables developers to create, publish, maintain, monitor, and
secure APIs at any scale. Amazon CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) service that can
improve the performance and security of web applications. The developer can use CloudFront and a
custom domain name for the API Gateway REST API. To do so, the developer needs to import the
SSL/TLS certificate into AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) in the us-east-1 Region. This is because
CloudFront requires certificates from ACM to be in this Region. The developer also needs to create a
DNS CNAME record for the custom domain that points to the CloudFront distribution.

QUESTION 37
A company has an Amazon S3 bucket that contains sensitive dat
a. The data must be encrypted in transit and at rest. The company encrypts the data in the S3 bucket
by using an AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) key. A developer needs to grant several other
AWS accounts the permission to use the S3 GetObject operation to retrieve the data from the S3
bucket.
How can the developer enforce that all requests to retrieve the data provide encryption in transit?
A. Define a resource-based policy on the S3 bucket to deny access when a request meets the
condition œaws:SecureTransport : œfalse .
B. Define a resource-based policy on the S3 bucket to allow access when a request meets the
condition œaws:SecureTransport : œfalse .
C. Define a role-based policy on the other accounts' roles to deny access when a request meets the
condition of œaws:SecureTransport : œfalse .
D. Define a resource-based policy on the KMS key to deny access when a request meets the condition
of œaws:SecureTransport : œfalse .

Answer: A
Explanation:
Amazon S3 supports resource-based policies, which are JSON documents that specify the
permissions for accessing S3 resources. A resource-based policy can be used to enforce encryption in
transit by denying access to requests that do not use HTTPS. The condition key aws:SecureTransport
can be used to check if the request was sent using SSL. If the value of this key is false, the request is
denied; otherwise, the request is allowed. Reference: How do I use an S3 bucket policy to require
requests to use Secure Socket Layer (SSL)?
QUESTION 38
An application that is hosted on an Amazon EC2 instance needs access to files that are stored in an
Amazon S3 bucket. The application lists the objects that are stored in the S3 bucket and displays a
table to the user. During testing, a developer discovers that the application does not show any
objects in the list.
What is the MOST secure way to resolve this issue?
A. Update the IAM instance profile that is attached to the EC2 instance to include the S3:* permission
for the S3 bucket.
B. Update the IAM instance profile that is attached to the EC2 instance to include the S3:ListBucket
permission for the S3 bucket.
C. Update the developer's user permissions to include the S3:ListBucket permission for the S3
bucket.
D. Update the S3 bucket policy by including the S3:ListBucket permission and by setting the Principal
element to specify the account number of the EC2 instance.
Answer: B
Explanation:
IAM instance profiles are containers for IAM roles that can be associated with EC2 instances. An IAM
role is a set of permissions that grant access to AWS resources. An IAM role can be used to allow an
EC2 instance to access an S3 bucket by including the appropriate permissions in the roles policy. The
S3:ListBucket permission allows listing the objects in an S3 bucket. By updating the IAM instance
profile with this permission, the application on the EC2 instance can retrieve the objects from the S3
bucket and display them to the user. Reference: Using an IAM role to grant permissions to
applications running on Amazon EC2 instances

development team needs to access the license keys in automaton scripts that run in Amazon EC2
instances and in AWS CloudFormation stacks.

Which solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?
A. Amazon S3 with encrypted files prefixed with œconfig
B. AWS Secrets Manager secrets with a tag that is named SecretString
C. AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store SecureString parameters
D. CloudFormation NoEcho parameters
Answer: C
Explanation:
AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store is a service that provides secure, hierarchical storage for
configuration data and secrets. Parameter Store supports SecureString parameters, which are
encrypted using AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) keys. SecureString parameters can be
used to store license keys in AWS and retrieve them securely from automation scripts that run in EC2
instances or CloudFormation stacks. Parameter Store is a cost-effective solution because it does not
charge for storing parameters or API calls. Reference: Working with Systems Manager parameters
QUESTION 40
A company has deployed infrastructure on AWS. A development team wants to create an AWS
Lambda function that will retrieve data from an Amazon Aurora database. The Amazon Aurora
database is in a private subnet in company's VPC. The VPC is named VPC1. The data is relational in
nature. The Lambda function needs to access the data securely.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A. Create the Lambda function. Configure VPC1 access for the function. Attach a security group
named SG1 to both the Lambda function and the database. Configure the security group inbound
and outbound rules to allow TCP traffic on Port 3306.
B. Create and launch a Lambda function in a new public subnet that is in a new VPC named VPC2.
Create a peering connection between VPC1 and VPC2.
C. Create the Lambda function. Configure VPC1 access for the function. Assign a security group
named SG1 to the Lambda function. Assign a second security group named SG2 to the database. Add
an inbound rule to SG1 to allow TCP traffic from Port 3306.
D. Export the data from the Aurora database to Amazon S3. Create and launch a Lambda function in
VPC1. Configure the Lambda function query the data from Amazon S3.
Answer: A
Explanation:
AWS Lambda is a service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. Lambda
functions can be configured to access resources in a VPC, such as an Aurora database, by specifying
one or more subnets and security groups in the VPC settings of the function. A security group acts as
a virtual firewall that controls inbound and outbound traffic for the resources in a VPC. To allow a

Lambda function to communicate with an Aurora database, both resources need to be associated
with the same security group, and the security group rules need to allow TCP traffic on Port 3306,
which is the default port for MySQL databases. Reference: [Configuring a Lambda function to access
resources in a VPC]
QUESTION 41
A developer is building a web application that uses Amazon API Gateway to expose an AWS Lambda
function to process requests from clients. During testing, the developer notices that the API Gateway
times out even though the Lambda function finishes under the set time limit.
Which of the following API Gateway metrics in Amazon CloudWatch can help the developer
troubleshoot the issue? (Choose two.)
A. CacheHitCount
B. IntegrationLatency
C. CacheMissCount
D. Latency
E. Count
Answer: B, D
Explanation:
Amazon API Gateway is a service that enables developers to create, publish, maintain, monitor, and
secure APIs at any scale. Amazon CloudWatch is a service that monitors AWS resources and
applications. API Gateway provides several CloudWatch metrics to help developers troubleshoot
issues with their APIs. Two of the metrics that can help the developer troubleshoot the issue of API
Gateway timing out are:
IntegrationLatency: This metric measures the time between when API Gateway relays a request to
the backend and when it receives a response from the backend. A high value for this metric indicates
that the backend is taking too long to respond and may cause API Gateway to time out.
Latency: This metric measures the time between when API Gateway receives a request from a client
and when it returns a response to the client. A high value for this metric indicates that either the
integration latency is high or API Gateway is taking too long to process the request or response.

Explanation:
AWS Lambda is a service that lets developers run code without provisioning or managing servers.
Lambda layers are a distribution mechanism for libraries, custom runtimes, and other dependencies.
The developer can create a Lambda layer with the required Python library and use the layer in both
Lambda functions. This will reduce the size of the Lambda deployment packages and avoid reaching
the quota for the maximum size of zipped deployment packages. The developer can also benefit
from using layers to manage dependencies separately from function code.

QUESTION 47
An application uses an Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group. A developer notices that EC2 instances are
taking a long time to become available during scale-out events. The UserData script is taking a long
time to run.
The developer must implement a solution to decrease the time that elapses before an EC2 instance
becomes available. The solution must make the most recent version of the application available at all
times and must apply all available security updates. The solution also must minimize the number of
images that are created. The images must be validated.
Which combination of steps should the developer take to meet these requirements? (Choose two.)
A. Use EC2 Image Builder to create an Amazon Machine Image (AMI). Install all the patches and
agents that are needed to manage and run the application. Update the Auto Scaling group launch
configuration to use the AMI.
B. Use EC2 Image Builder to create an Amazon Machine Image (AMI). Install the latest version of the
application and all the patches and agents that are needed to manage and run the application.
Update the Auto Scaling group launch configuration to use the AMI.
C. Set up AWS CodeDeploy to deploy the most recent version of the application at runtime.
D. Set up AWS CodePipeline to deploy the most recent version of the application at runtime.
E. Remove any commands that perform operating system patching from the UserData script.
Answer: BE
Explanation:
AWS CloudFormation is a service that enables developers to model and provision AWS resources
using templates. The developer can use the following steps to avoid accidental database deletion in

the future:
Set up AWS CodeDeploy to deploy the most recent version of the application at runtime. This will
ensure that the application code is always up to date and does not depend on the AMI.
Remove any commands that perform operating system patching from the UserData script. This will
reduce the time that the UserData script takes to run and speed up the instance launch process.

QUESTION 48
A developer is creating an AWS Lambda function that needs credentials to connect to an Amazon
RDS for MySQL database. An Amazon S3 bucket currently stores the credentials. The developer needs
to improve the existing solution by implementing credential rotation and secure storage. The
developer also needs to provide integration with the Lambda function.
Which solution should the developer use to store and retrieve the credentials with the LEAST
management overhead?
A. Store the credentials in AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store. Select the database that the
parameter will access. Use the default AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) key to encrypt the
parameter. Enable automatic rotation for the parameter. Use the parameter from Parameter Store on
the Lambda function to connect to the database.
B. Encrypt the credentials with the default AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) key. Store the
credentials as environment variables for the Lambda function. Create a second Lambda function to
generate new credentials and to rotate the credentials by updating the environment variables of the
first Lambda function. Invoke the second Lambda function by using an Amazon EventBridge rule that
runs on a schedule. Update the database to use the new credentials. On the first Lambda function,
retrieve the credentials from the environment variables. Decrypt the credentials by using AWS KMS,
Connect to the database.
C. Store the credentials in AWS Secrets Manager. Set the secret type to Credentials for Amazon RDS
database. Select the database that the secret will access. Use the default AWS Key Management
Service (AWS KMS) key to encrypt the secret. Enable automatic rotation for the secret. Use the secret
from Secrets Manager on the Lambda function to connect to the database.
D. Encrypt the credentials by using AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS). Store the credentials
in an Amazon DynamoDB table. Create a second Lambda function to rotate the credentials. Invoke
the second Lambda function by using an Amazon EventBridge rule that runs on a schedule. Update
the DynamoDB table. Update the database to use the generated credentials. Retrieve the credentials
from DynamoDB with the first Lambda function. Connect to the database.
Answer: C
Explanation:

AWS Secrets Manager is a service that helps you protect secrets needed to access your applications,
services, and IT resources. Secrets Manager enables you to store, retrieve, and rotate secrets such as
database credentials, API keys, and passwords. Secrets Manager supports a secret type for RDS
databases, which allows you to select an existing RDS database instance and generate credentials for
it. Secrets Manager encrypts the secret using AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) keys and
enables automatic rotation of the secret at a specified interval. A Lambda function can use the AWS
SDK or CLI to retrieve the secret from Secrets Manager and use it to connect to the database.

QUESTION 49
A developer has written the following IAM policy to provide access to an Amazon S3 bucket:
Which access does the policy allow regarding the s3:GetObject and s3:PutObject actions?
A. Access on all buckets except the œDOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET bucket
B. Access on all buckets that start with œDOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET except the œDOC-EXAMPLEBUCKET/
secrets bucket
C. Access on all objects in the œDOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET bucket along with access to all S3 actions for
objects in the œDOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET bucket that start with œsecrets
D. Access on all objects in the œDOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET bucket except on objects that start with
œsecrets

Answer: D
Explanation:
The IAM policy shown in the image is a resource-based policy that grants or denies access to an S3
bucket based on certain conditions. The first statement allows access to any S3 action on any object
in the œDOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET bucket when the request is made over HTTPS (the value of
aws:SecureTransport is true). The second statement denies access to the s3:GetObject and
s3:PutObject actions on any object in the œDOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/secrets prefix when the request
is made over HTTP (the value of aws:SecureTransport is false). Therefore, the policy allows access on
all objects in the œDOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET bucket except on objects that start with œsecrets .

QUESTION 50
A developer is creating a mobile app that calls a backend service by using an Amazon API Gateway
REST API. For integration testing during the development phase, the developer wants to simulate
different backend responses without invoking the backend service.
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?
A. Create an AWS Lambda function. Use API Gateway proxy integration to return constant HTTP
responses.
B. Create an Amazon EC2 instance that serves the backend REST API by using an AWS
CloudFormation template.
C. Customize the API Gateway stage to select a response type based on the request.
D. Use a request mapping template to select the mock integration response.
Answer: D
Explanation:
Amazon API Gateway supports mock integration responses, which are predefined responses that can
be returned without sending requests to a backend service. Mock integration responses can be used
for testing or prototyping purposes, or for simulating different backend responses based on certain
conditions. A request mapping template can be used to select a mock integration response based on
an expression that evaluates some aspects of the request, such as headers, query strings, or body
content. This solution does not require any additional resources or code changes and has the least
operational overhead. Reference: Set up mock integrations for an API Gateway REST API

depend on the on-premises application for proper functioning. In case of any application errors, the
developer wants to be able to use Amazon CloudWatch to monitor and troubleshoot all applications

from one place.
How can the developer accomplish this?
A. Install an AWS SDK on the on-premises server to automatically send logs to CloudWatch.
B. Download the CloudWatch agent to the on-premises server. Configure the agent to use IAM user
credentials with permissions for CloudWatch.
C. Upload log files from the on-premises server to Amazon S3 and have CloudWatch read the files.
D. Upload log files from the on-premises server to an Amazon EC2 instance and have the instance
forward the logs to CloudWatch.
Answer: B
Explanation:
Amazon CloudWatch is a service that monitors AWS resources and applications. The developer can
use CloudWatch to monitor and troubleshoot all applications from one place. To do so, the developer
needs to download the CloudWatch agent to the on-premises server and configure the agent to use
IAM user credentials with permissions for CloudWatch. The agent will collect logs and metrics from
the on-premises server and send them to CloudWatch.

QUESTION 53
A developer is using an AWS Lambda function to generate avatars for profile pictures that are
uploaded to an Amazon S3 bucket. The Lambda function is automatically invoked for profile pictures
that are saved under the /original/ S3 prefix. The developer notices that some pictures cause the
Lambda function to time out. The developer wants to implement a fallback mechanism by using
another Lambda function that resizes the profile picture.
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST development effort?
A. Set the image resize Lambda function as a destination of the avatar generator Lambda function for
the events that fail processing.
B. Create an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. Set the SQS queue as a destination
with an on failure condition for the avatar generator Lambda function. Configure the image resize
Lambda function to poll from the SQS queue.
C. Create an AWS Step Functions state machine that invokes the avatar generator Lambda function
and uses the image resize Lambda function as a fallback. Create an Amazon EventBridge rule that
matches events from the S3 bucket to invoke the state machine.
D. Create an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic. Set the SNS topic as a
destination with an on failure condition for the avatar generator Lambda function. Subscribe the
image resize Lambda function to the SNS topic.
Answer: A
Explanation:
The solution that will meet the requirements with the least development effort is to set the image
resize Lambda function as a destination of the avatar generator Lambda function for the events that
fail processing. This way, the fallback mechanism is automatically triggered by the Lambda service
without requiring any additional components or configuration. The other options involve creating
and managing additional resources such as queues, topics, state machines, or rules, which would
increase the complexity and cost of the solution.

QUESTION 54
A developer needs to migrate an online retail application to AWS to handle an anticipated increase in
traffic. The application currently runs on two servers: one server for the web application and another
server for the database. The web server renders webpages and manages session state in memory.
The database server hosts a MySQL database that contains order details. When traffic to the
application is heavy, the memory usage for the web server approaches 100% and the application
slows down considerably.
The developer has found that most of the memory increase and performance decrease is related to
the load of managing additional user sessions. For the web server migration, the developer will use
Amazon EC2 instances with an Auto Scaling group behind an Application Load Balancer.
Which additional set of changes should the developer make to the application to improve the
application's performance?
A. Use an EC2 instance to host the MySQL database. Store the session data and the application data
in the MySQL database.
B. Use Amazon ElastiCache for Memcached to store and manage the session data. Use an Amazon
RDS for MySQL DB instance to store the application data.
C. Use Amazon ElastiCache for Memcached to store and manage the session data and the application
data.
D. Use the EC2 instance store to manage the session data. Use an Amazon RDS for MySQL DB
instance to store the application data.
Answer: B
Explanation:
Using Amazon ElastiCache for Memcached to store and manage the session data will reduce the
memory load and improve the performance of the web server. Using Amazon RDS for MySQL DB
instance to store the application data will provide a scalable, reliable, and managed database service.
Option A is not optimal because it does not address the memory issue of the web server. Option C is
not optimal because it does not provide a persistent storage for the application data. Option D is not
optimal because it does not provide a high availability and durability for the session data.
Reference: Amazon ElastiCache, Amazon RDS
QUESTION 55
An application uses Lambda functions to extract metadata from files uploaded to an S3 bucket; the
metadata is stored in Amazon DynamoDB. The application starts behaving unexpectedly, and the
developer wants to examine the logs of the Lambda function code for errors.
Based on this system configuration, where would the developer find the logs?
A. Amazon S3
B. AWS CloudTrail

C. Amazon CloudWatch
D. Amazon DynamoDB
Answer: C
Explanation:
Amazon CloudWatch is the service that collects and stores logs from AWS Lambda functions. The
developer can use CloudWatch Logs Insights to query and analyze the logs for errors and metrics.
Option A is not correct because Amazon S3 is a storage service that does not store Lambda function
logs. Option B is not correct because AWS CloudTrail is a service that records API calls and events for
AWS services, not Lambda function logs. Option D is not correct because Amazon DynamoDB is a
database service that does not store Lambda function logs.
Reference: AWS Lambda Monitoring, [CloudWatch Logs Insights]
QUESTION 56
A company is using an AWS Lambda function to process records from an Amazon Kinesis data stream.
The company recently observed slow processing of the records. A developer notices that the iterator
age metric for the function is increasing and that the Lambda run duration is constantly above
normal.
Which actions should the developer take to increase the processing speed? (Choose two.)
A. Increase the number of shards of the Kinesis data stream.
B. Decrease the timeout of the Lambda function.
C. Increase the memory that is allocated to the Lambda function.
D. Decrease the number of shards of the Kinesis data stream.
E. Increase the timeout of the Lambda function.
Answer: A, C
Explanation:
Increasing the number of shards of the Kinesis data stream will increase the throughput and
parallelism of the data processing. Increasing the memory that is allocated to the Lambda function
will also increase the CPU and network performance of the function, which will reduce the run
duration and improve the processing speed. Option B is not correct because decreasing the timeout
of the Lambda function will not affect the processing speed, but may cause some records to fail if
they exceed the timeout limit. Option D is not correct because decreasing the number of shards of
the Kinesis data stream will decrease the throughput and parallelism of the data processing, which
will slow down the processing speed. Option E is not correct because increasing the timeout of the
Lambda function will not affect the processing speed, but may increase the cost of running the
function.

QUESTION 57
A company needs to harden its container images before the images are in a running state. The
company's application uses Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR) as an image registry.
Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) for compute, and an AWS CodePipeline pipeline
that orchestrates a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) workflow.
Dynamic application security testing occurs in the final stage of the pipeline after a new image is
deployed to a development namespace in the EKS cluster. A developer needs to place an analysis
stage before this deployment to analyze the container image earlier in the CI/CD pipeline.
Which solution will meet these requirements with the MOST operational efficiency?
A. Build the container image and run the docker scan command locally. Mitigate any findings before
pushing changes to the source code repository. Write a pre-commit hook that enforces the use of this
workflow before commit.
B. Create a new CodePipeline stage that occurs after the container image is built. Configure ECR basic
image scanning to scan on image push. Use an AWS Lambda function as the action provider.
Configure the Lambda function to check the scan results and to fail the pipeline if there are findings.
C. Create a new CodePipeline stage that occurs after source code has been retrieved from its
repository. Run a security scanner on the latest revision of the source code. Fail the pipeline if there
are findings.
D. Add an action to the deployment stage of the pipeline so that the action occurs before the
deployment to the EKS cluster. Configure ECR basic image scanning to scan on image push. Use an
AWS Lambda function as the action provider. Configure the Lambda function to check the scan
results and to fail the pipeline if there are findings.
Answer: B
Explanation:
The solution that will meet the requirements with the most operational efficiency is to create a new
CodePipeline stage that occurs after the container image is built. Configure ECR basic image scanning
to scan on image push. Use an AWS Lambda function as the action provider. Configure the Lambda
function to check the scan results and to fail the pipeline if there are findings. This way, the container
image is analyzed earlier in the CI/CD pipeline and any vulnerabilities are detected and reported
before deploying to the EKS cluster. The other options either delay the analysis until after
deployment, which increases the risk of exposing insecure images, or perform analysis on the source
code instead of the container image, which may not capture all the dependencies and configurations
that affect the security posture of the image.
Reference: Amazon ECR image scanning
QUESTION 58
A developer is testing a new file storage application that uses an Amazon CloudFront distribution to
serve content from an Amazon S3 bucket. The distribution accesses the S3 bucket by using an origin
access identity (OAI). The S3 bucket's permissions explicitly deny access to all other users.

The application prompts users to authenticate on a login page and then uses signed cookies to allow
users to access their personal storage directories. The developer has configured the distribution to
use its default cache behavior with restricted viewer access and has set the origin to point to the S3
bucket. However, when the developer tries to navigate to the login page, the developer receives a
403 Forbidden error.
The developer needs to implement a solution to allow unauthenticated access to the login page. The
solution also must keep all private content secure.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A. Add a second cache behavior to the distribution with the same origin as the default cache
behavior. Set the path pattern for the second cache behavior to the path of the login page, and make
viewer access unrestricted. Keep the default cache behavior's settings unchanged.
B. Add a second cache behavior to the distribution with the same origin as the default cache
behavior. Set the path pattern for the second cache behavior to *, and make viewer access restricted.
Change the default cache behavior's path pattern to the path of the login page, and make viewer
access unrestricted.
C. Add a second origin as a failover origin to the default cache behavior. Point the failover origin to
the S3 bucket. Set the path pattern for the primary origin to *, and make viewer access restricted. Set
the path pattern for the failover origin to the path of the login page, and make viewer access
unrestricted.
D. Add a bucket policy to the S3 bucket to allow read access. Set the resource on the policy to the
Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the login page object in the S3 bucket. Add a CloudFront function
to the default cache behavior to redirect unauthorized requests to the login page's S3 URL.
Answer: A
Explanation:
The solution that will meet the requirements is to add a second cache behavior to the distribution
with the same origin as the default cache behavior. Set the path pattern for the second cache
behavior to the path of the login page, and make viewer access unrestricted. Keep the default cache
behaviors settings unchanged. This way, the login page can be accessed without authentication,
while all other content remains secure and requires signed cookies. The other options either do not
allow unauthenticated access to the login page, or expose private content to unauthorized users.

A. Run the amplify add test command in the Amplify CLI.

B. Create unit tests in the application. Deploy the unit tests by using the amplify push command in
the Amplify CLI.
C. Add a test phase to the amplify.yml build settings for the application.
D. Add a test phase to the aws-exports.js file for the application.
Answer: C
Explanation:
The solution that will meet the requirements is to add a test phase to the amplify.yml build settings
for the application. This way, the developer can run end-to-end tests on every code commit and
catch any bugs before deploying to production. The other options either do not support end-to-end
testing, or do not run tests automatically.

QUESTION 60
An ecommerce company is using an AWS Lambda function behind Amazon API Gateway as its
application tier. To process orders during checkout, the application calls a POST API from the
frontend. The POST API invokes the Lambda function asynchronously. In rare situations, the
application has not processed orders. The Lambda application logs show no errors or failures.
What should a developer do to solve this problem?
A. Inspect the frontend logs for API failures. Call the POST API manually by using the requests from
the log file.
B. Create and inspect the Lambda dead-letter queue. Troubleshoot the failed functions. Reprocess
the events.
C. Inspect the Lambda logs in Amazon CloudWatch for possible errors. Fix the errors.
D. Make sure that caching is disabled for the POST API in API Gateway.
Answer: B
Explanation:
The solution that will solve this problem is to create and inspect the Lambda dead-letter queue.
Troubleshoot the failed functions. Reprocess the events. This way, the developer can identify and fix
any issues that caused the Lambda function to fail when invoked asynchronously by API Gateway.
The developer can also reprocess any orders that were not processed due to failures. The other
options either do not address the root cause of the problem, or do not help recover from failures.

QUESTION 61
A company is building a web application on AWS. When a customer sends a request, the application
will generate reports and then make the reports available to the customer within one hour. Reports
should be accessible to the customer for 8 hours. Some reports are larger than 1 MB. Each report is

unique to the customer. The application should delete all reports that are older than 2 days.
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?
A. Generate the reports and then store the reports as Amazon DynamoDB items that have a specified
TTL. Generate a URL that retrieves the reports from DynamoDB. Provide the URL to customers
through the web application.
B. Generate the reports and then store the reports in an Amazon S3 bucket that uses server-side
encryption. Attach the reports to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) message.
Subscribe the customer to email notifications from Amazon SNS.
C. Generate the reports and then store the reports in an Amazon S3 bucket that uses server-side
encryption. Generate a presigned URL that contains an expiration date Provide the URL to customers
through the web application. Add S3 Lifecycle configuration rules to the S3 bucket to delete old
reports.
D. Generate the reports and then store the reports in an Amazon RDS database with a date stamp.
Generate an URL that retrieves the reports from the RDS database. Provide the URL to customers
through the web application. Schedule an hourly AWS Lambda function to delete database records
that have expired date stamps.
Answer: C
Explanation:
This solution will meet the requirements with the least operational overhead because it uses
Amazon S3 as a scalable, secure, and durable storage service for the reports. The presigned URL will
allow customers to access their reports for a limited time (8 hours) without requiring additional
authentication. The S3 Lifecycle configuration rules will automatically delete the reports that are
older than 2 days, reducing storage costs and complying with the data retention policy. Option A is
not optimal because it will incur additional costs and complexity to store the reports as DynamoDB
items, which have a size limit of 400 KB. Option B is not optimal because it will not provide
customers with access to their reports within one hour, as Amazon SNS email delivery is not
guaranteed. Option D is not optimal because it will require more operational overhead to manage an
RDS database and a Lambda function for storing and deleting the reports.

QUESTION 62
A company has deployed an application on AWS Elastic Beanstalk. The company has configured the
Auto Scaling group that is associated with the Elastic Beanstalk environment to have five Amazon EC2
instances. If the capacity is fewer than four EC2 instances during the deployment, application
performance degrades. The company is using the all-at-once deployment policy.
What is the MOST cost-effective way to solve the deployment issue?
A. Change the Auto Scaling group to six desired instances.
B. Change the deployment policy to traffic splitting. Specify an evaluation time of 1 hour.

C. Change the deployment policy to rolling with additional batch. Specify a batch size of 1.
D. Change the deployment policy to rolling. Specify a batch size of 2.
Answer: C
Explanation:
This solution will solve the deployment issue by deploying the new version of the application to one
new EC2 instance at a time, while keeping the old version running on the existing instances. This way,
there will always be at least four instances serving traffic during the deployment, and no downtime
or performance degradation will occur. Option A is not optimal because it will increase the cost of
running the Elastic Beanstalk environment without solving the deployment issue. Option B is not
optimal because it will split the traffic between two versions of the application, which may cause
inconsistency and confusion for the customers. Option D is not optimal because it will deploy the
new version of the application to two existing instances at a time, which may reduce the capacity
below four instances during the deployment.

QUESTION 63
A developer is incorporating AWS X-Ray into an application that handles personal identifiable
information (PII). The application is hosted on Amazon EC2 instances. The application trace messages
include encrypted PII and go to Amazon CloudWatch. The developer needs to ensure that no PII goes
outside of the EC2 instances.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A. Manually instrument the X-Ray SDK in the application code.
B. Use the X-Ray auto-instrumentation agent.
C. Use Amazon Macie to detect and hide PII. Call the X-Ray API from AWS Lambda.
D. Use AWS Distro for Open Telemetry.
Answer: A
Explanation:
This solution will meet the requirements by allowing the developer to control what data is sent to XRay
and CloudWatch from the application code. The developer can filter out any PII from the trace
messages before sending them to X-Ray and CloudWatch, ensuring that no PII goes outside of the
EC2 instances. Option B is not optimal because it will automatically instrument all incoming and
outgoing requests from the application, which may include PII in the trace messages. Option C is not
optimal because it will require additional services and costs to use Amazon Macie and AWS Lambda,
which may not be able to detect and hide all PII from the trace messages. Option D is not optimal
because it will use Open Telemetry instead of X-Ray, which may not be compatible with CloudWatch
and other AWS services.

QUESTION 64
A developer is migrating some features from a legacy monolithic application to use AWS Lambda
functions instead. The application currently stores data in an Amazon Aurora DB cluster that runs in
private subnets in a VPC. The AWS account has one VPC deployed. The Lambda functions and the DB
cluster are deployed in the same AWS Region in the same AWS account.
The developer needs to ensure that the Lambda functions can securely access the DB cluster without
crossing the public internet.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A. Configure the DB cluster's public access setting to Yes.
B. Configure an Amazon RDS database proxy for the Lambda functions.
C. Configure a NAT gateway and a security group for the Lambda functions.
D. Configure the VPC, subnets, and a security group for the Lambda functions.
Answer: D
Explanation:
This solution will meet the requirements by allowing the Lambda functions to access the DB cluster
securely within the same VPC without crossing the public internet. The developer can configure a
VPC endpoint for RDS in a private subnet and assign it to the Lambda functions. The developer can
also configure a security group for the Lambda functions that allows inbound traffic from the DB
cluster on port 3306 (MySQL). Option A is not optimal because it will expose the DB cluster to public
access, which may compromise its security and data integrity. Option B is not optimal because it will
introduce additional latency and complexity to use an RDS database proxy for accessing the DB
cluster from Lambda functions within the same VPC. Option C is not optimal because it will require
additional costs and configuration to use a NAT gateway for accessing resources in private subnets
from Lambda functions.

QUESTION 65
A developer is building a new application on AWS. The application uses an AWS Lambda function
that retrieves information from an Amazon DynamoDB table. The developer hard coded the
DynamoDB table name into the Lambda function code. The table name might change over time. The
developer does not want to modify the Lambda code if the table name changes.
Which solution will meet these requirements MOST efficiently?
A. Create a Lambda environment variable to store the table name. Use the standard method for the
programming language to retrieve the variable.
B. Store the table name in a file. Store the file in the /tmp folder. Use the SDK for the programming
language to retrieve the table name.
C. Create a file to store the table name. Zip the file and upload the file to the Lambda layer. Use the

SDK for the programming language to retrieve the table name.
D. Create a global variable that is outside the handler in the Lambda function to store the table
name.
Answer: A
Explanation:
The solution that will meet the requirements most efficiently is to create a Lambda environment
variable to store the table name. Use the standard method for the programming language to retrieve
the variable. This way, the developer can avoid hard-coding the table name in the Lambda function
code and easily change the table name by updating the environment variable. The other options
either involve storing the table name in a file, which is less efficient and secure than using an
environment variable, or creating a global variable, which is not recommended as it can cause
concurrency issues.

usage at 1minute intervals and send the usage readings to a remote endpoint tot collection. The
company needs to create an endpoint that will receive the smart meter readings and store the
readings in a database. The company wants to store the location ID and timestamp information.
The company wants to give Is customers low-latency access to their current usage and historical
usage on demand The company expects demand to increase significantly. The solution must not
impact performance or include downtime write seeing.
When solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?
A. Store the smart meter readings in an Amazon RDS database. Create an index on the location ID
and timestamp columns Use the columns to filter on the customers ˜data.
B. Store the smart motor readings m an Amazon DynamoDB table Croato a composite Key oy using
the location ID and timestamp columns. Use the columns to filter on the customers' data.
C. Store the smart meter readings in Amazon EastCache for Reds Create a Sorted set key y using the
location ID and timestamp columns. Use the columns to filter on the customers data.
D. Store the smart meter readings m Amazon S3 Parton the data by using the location ID and
timestamp columns. Use Amazon Athena lo tiler on me customers' data.
Answer: B
Explanation:
The solution that will meet the requirements most cost-effectively is to store the smart meter
readings in an Amazon DynamoDB table. Create a composite key by using the location ID and
timestamp columns. Use the columns to filter on the customers data. This way, the company can
leverage the scalability, performance, and low latency of DynamoDB to store and retrieve the smart

meter readings. The company can also use the composite key to query the data by location ID and
timestamp efficiently. The other options either involve more expensive or less scalable services, or
do not provide low-latency access to the current usage.

QUESTION 67
A companys website runs on an Amazon EC2 instance and uses Auto Scaling to scale the
environment during peak times. Website users across the world ate experiencing high latency flue lo
sialic content on theEC2 instance. even during non-peak hours.
When companion of steps mill resolves the latency issue? (Select TWO)
A. Double the Auto Scaling group's maximum number of servers
B. Host the application code on AWS lambda
C. Scale vertically by resizing the EC2 instances
D. Create an Amazon Cloudfront distribution to cache the static content
E. Store the applications sialic content in Amazon S3
Answer: DE
Explanation:
The combination of steps that will resolve the latency issue is to create an Amazon CloudFront
distribution to cache the static content and store the applications static content in Amazon S3. This
way, the company can use CloudFront to deliver the static content from edge locations that are
closer to the website users, reducing latency and improving performance. The company can also use
S3 to store the static content reliably and cost-effectively, and integrate it with CloudFront easily. The
other options either do not address the latency issue, or are not necessary or feasible for the given
scenario.

QUESTION 68
An online food company provides an Amazon API Gateway HTTP API 1o receive orders for partners.
The API is integrated with an AWS Lambda function. The Lambda function stores the orders in an
Amazon DynamoDB table.
The company expects to onboard additional partners Some to me panthers require additional
Lambda function to receive orders. The company has created an Amazon S3 bucket. The company
needs 10 store all orders and updates m the S3 bucket for future analysis
How can the developer ensure that an orders and updates are stored to Amazon S3 with the LEAST
development effort?
A. Create a new Lambda function and a new API Gateway API endpoint. Configure the new Lambda
function to write to the S3 bucket. Modify the original Lambda function to post updates to the new
API endpoint.

B. Use Amazon Kinesis Data Streams to create a new data stream. Modify the Lambda function to
publish orders to the oats stream Configure in data stream to write to the S3 bucket.
C. Enable DynamoDB Streams on me DynamoOB table. Create a new lambda function. Associate the
stream's Amazon Resource Name (ARN) with the Lambda Function Configure the Lambda function to
write to the S3 bucket as records appear in the tables stream.
D. Modify the Lambda function to punish to a new Amazon. Simple Lambda function receives orders.
Subscribe a new Lambda function to the topic. Configure the new Lambda function to write to the S3
bucket as updates come through the topic.
Answer: C
Explanation:
This solution will ensure that all orders and updates are stored to Amazon S3 with the least
development effort because it uses DynamoDB Streams to capture changes in the DynamoDB table
and trigger a Lambda function to write those changes to the S3 bucket. This way, the original Lambda
function and API Gateway API endpoint do not need to be modified, and no additional services are
required. Option A is not optimal because it will require more development effort to create a new
Lambda function and a new API Gateway API endpoint, and to modify the original Lambda function
to post updates to the new API endpoint. Option B is not optimal because it will introduce additional
costs and complexity to use Amazon Kinesis Data Streams to create a new data stream, and to modify
the Lambda function to publish orders to the data stream. Option D is not optimal because it will
require more development effort to modify the Lambda function to publish to a new Amazon SNS
topic, and to create and subscribe a new Lambda function to the topic.

QUESTION 69
A company has an Amazon S3 bucket containing premier content that it intends to make available to
only paid subscribers of its website. The S3 bucket currently has default permissions of all objects
being private to prevent inadvertent exposure of the premier content to non-paying website visitors.
How can the company Limit the ability to download a premier content file in the S3 Bucket to paid
subscribers only?
A. Apply a bucket policy that allows anonymous users to download the content from the S3 bucket.
B. Generate a pre-signed object URL for the premier content file when a pad subscriber requests a
download.
C. Add a Docket policy that requires multi-factor authentication for request to access the S3 bucket
objects.
D. Enable server-side encryption on the S3 bucket for data protection against the non-paying website
visitors.
Answer: B

Explanation:
This solution will limit the ability to download a premier content file in the S3 bucket to paid
subscribers only because it uses a pre-signed object URL that grants temporary access to an S3 object
for a specified duration. The pre-signed object URL can be generated by the companys website when
a paid subscriber requests a download, and can be verified by Amazon S3 using the signature in the
URL. Option A is not optimal because it will allow anyone to download the content from the S3
bucket without verifying their subscription status. Option C is not optimal because it will require
additional steps and costs to configure multi-factor authentication for accessing the S3 bucket
objects, which may not be feasible or user-friendly for paid subscribers. Option D is not optimal
because it will not prevent non-paying website visitors from accessing the S3 bucket objects, but only
encrypt them at rest.

QUESTION 70
A developer is creating an AWS Lambda function that searches for Items from an Amazon DynamoDQ
table that contains customer contact information. The DynamoDB table items have the customers as
the partition and additional properties such as customer -type, name, and job_title.
The Lambda function runs whenever a user types a new character into the customer_type text Input.
The developer wants to search to return partial matches of all tne email_address property of a
particular customer type. The developer does not want to recreate the DynamoDB table.
What should the developer do to meet these requirements?
A. Add a global secondary index (GSI) to the DynamoDB table with customer-type input, as the
partition key and email_address as the sort key. Perform a query operation on the GSI by using the
begins with key condition expression with the email_address property.
B. Add a global secondary index (GSI) to the DynamoDB table with email_address as the partition key
and customer_type as the sort key. Perform a query operation on the GSI by using the begine_with
key condition expresses with the email. Address property.
C. Add a local secondary index (LSI) to the DynemoOB table with customer_type as the partition Key
and email_address as the sort Key. Perform a quick operation on the LSI by using the begine_with
Key condition expression with the email-address property.
D. Add a local secondary index (LSI) to the DynamoDB table with job-title as the partition key and
email_address as the sort key. Perform a query operation on the LSI by using the begins_with key
condition expression with the email_address property.
Answer: A
Explanation:
The solution that will meet the requirements is to add a global secondary index (GSI) to the
DynamoDB table with customer_type as the partition key and email_address as the sort key. Perform
a query operation on the GSI by using the begins_with key condition expression with the
email_address property. This way, the developer can search for partial matches of the email_address

property of a particular customer type without recreating the DynamoDB table. The other options
either involve using a local secondary index (LSI), which requires recreating the table, or using a
different partition key, which does not allow filtering by customer_type.

QUESTION 71
A developer is building an application that uses AWS API Gateway APIs. AWS Lambda function, and
AWS Dynamic DB tables. The developer uses the AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) to
build and run serverless applications on AWS. Each time the developer pushes of changes for only to
the Lambda functions, all the artifacts in the application are rebuilt.
The developer wants to implement AWS SAM Accelerate by running a command to only redeploy the
Lambda functions that have changed.
Which command will meet these requirements?
A. sam deploy -force-upload
B. sam deploy -no-execute-changeset
C. sam package
D. sam sync -watch
Answer: D
Explanation:
The command that will meet the requirements is sam sync -watch. This command enables AWS SAM
Accelerate mode, which allows the developer to only redeploy the Lambda functions that have
changed. The -watch flag enables file watching, which automatically detects changes in the source
code and triggers a redeployment. The other commands either do not enable AWS SAM Accelerate
mode, or do not redeploy the Lambda functions automatically.

QUESTION 72
A developer is building an application that gives users the ability to view bank account from multiple
sources in a single dashboard. The developer has automated the process to retrieve API credentials
for these sources. The process invokes an AWS Lambda function that is associated with an AWS
CloudFormation cotton resource.
The developer wants a solution that will store the API credentials with minimal operational
overhead.
When solution will meet these requirements?
A. Add an AWS Secrets Manager GenerateSecretString resource to the CloudFormation template. Set
the value to reference new credentials to the Cloudformation resource.
B. Use the AWS SDK ssm PutParameter operation in the Lambda function from the existing, custom
resource to store the credentials as a parameter. Set the parameter value to reference the new

credentials. Set ma parameter type to SecureString.
C. Add an AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store resource to the CloudFormation template. Set the
CloudFormation resource value to reference the new credentials Set the resource NoEcho attribute
to true.
D. Use the AWS SDK ssm PutParameter operation in the Lambda function from the existing custom
resources to store the credentials as a parameter. Set the parameter value to reference the new
credentials. Set the parameter NoEcho attribute to true.
Answer: B
Explanation:
The solution that will meet the requirements is to use the AWS SDK ssm PutParameter operation in
the Lambda function from the existing custom resource to store the credentials as a parameter. Set
the parameter value to reference the new credentials. Set the parameter type to SecureString. This
way, the developer can store the API credentials with minimal operational overhead, as AWS
Systems Manager Parameter Store provides secure and scalable storage for configuration data. The
SecureString parameter type encrypts the parameter value with AWS Key Management Service (AWS
KMS). The other options either involve adding additional resources to the CloudFormation template,
which increases complexity and cost, or do not encrypt the parameter value, which reduces security.

QUESTION 73
A developer is configuring an applications deployment environment in AWS CodePipeine. The
application code is stored in a GitHub repository. The developer wants to ensure that the repository
package's unit tests run in the new deployment environment. The deployment has already set the
pipeline's source provider to GitHub and has specified the repository and branch to use in the
deployment.
When combination of steps should the developer take next to meet these requirements with the
least the LEAST overhead' (Select TWO).
A. Create an AWS CodeCommt project. Add the repository package's build and test commands to the
protects buildspec
B. Create an AWS CodeBuid project. Add the repository package's build and test commands to the
projects buildspec
C. Create an AWS CodeDeploy protect. Add the repository package's build and test commands to the
project's buildspec
D. Add an action to the source stage. Specify the newly created project as the action provider. Specify
the build attract as the actions input artifact.
E. Add a new stage to the pipeline alter the source stage. Add an action to the new stage. Speedy the
newly created protect as the action provider. Specify the source artifact as the action's input artifact.
Answer: B, E

Explanation:
This solution will ensure that the repository packages unit tests run in the new deployment
environment with the least overhead because it uses AWS CodeBuild to build and test the code in a
fully managed service, and AWS CodePipeline to orchestrate the deployment stages and actions.
Option A is not optimal because it will use AWS CodeCommit instead of AWS CodeBuild, which is a
source control service, not a build and test service. Option C is not optimal because it will use AWS
CodeDeploy instead of AWS CodeBuild, which is a deployment service, not a build and test service.
Option D is not optimal because it will add an action to the source stage instead of creating a new
stage, which will not follow the best practice of separating different deployment phases.

QUESTION 74
A developer is trying get data from an Amazon DynamoDB table called demoman-table. The
developer configured the AWS CLI to use a specific IAM use's credentials and ran the following
command.
The command returned errors and no rows were returned.
What is the MOST likely cause of these issues?
A. The command is incorrect; it should be rewritten to use put-item with a string argument
B. The developer needs to log a ticket with AWS Support to enable access to the demoman-table
C. Amazon DynamoOB cannot be accessed from the AWS CLI and needs to called via the REST API
D. The IAM user needs an associated policy with read access to demoman-table
Answer: D
Explanation:
This solution will most likely solve the issues because it will grant the IAM user the necessary
permission to access the DynamoDB table using the AWS CLI command. The error message indicates
that the IAM user does not have sufficient access rights to perform the scan operation on the table.
Option A is not optimal because it will change the command to use put-item instead of scan, which
will not achieve the desired result of getting data from the table. Option B is not optimal because it
will involve contacting AWS Support, which may not be necessary or efficient for this issue. Option C
is not optimal because it will state that DynamoDB cannot be accessed from the AWS CLI, which is
incorrect as DynamoDB supports AWS CLI commands.

QUESTION 75
An organization is using Amazon CloudFront to ensure that its users experience low-latency access to

its web application. The organization has identified a need to encrypt all traffic between users and
CloudFront, and all traffic between CloudFront and the web application.
How can these requirements be met? (Select TWO)
A. Use AWS KMS t0 encrypt traffic between cloudFront and the web application.
B. Set the Origin Protocol Policy to "HTTPS Only".
C. Set the Origins HTTP Port to 443.
D. Set the Viewer Protocol Policy to "HTTPS Only" or Redirect HTTP to HTTPS"
E. Enable the CloudFront option Restrict Viewer Access.
Answer: B, D
Explanation:
This solution will meet the requirements by ensuring that all traffic between users and CloudFront,
and all traffic between CloudFront and the web application, are encrypted using HTTPS protocol. The
Origin Protocol Policy determines how CloudFront communicates with the origin server (the web
application), and setting it to œHTTPS Only will force CloudFront to use HTTPS for every request to
the origin server. The Viewer Protocol Policy determines how CloudFront responds to HTTP or HTTPS
requests from users, and setting it to œHTTPS Only or œRedirect HTTP to HTTPS will force CloudFront
to use HTTPS for every response to users. Option A is not optimal because it will use AWS KMS to
encrypt traffic between CloudFront and the web application, which is not necessary or supported by
CloudFront. Option C is not optimal because it will set the origins HTTP port to 443, which is
incorrect as port 443 is used for HTTPS protocol, not HTTP protocol. Option E is not optimal because
it will enable the CloudFront option Restrict Viewer Access, which is used for controlling access to
private content using signed URLs or signed cookies, not for encrypting traffic.

QUESTION 76
A company is developing an ecommerce application that uses Amazon API Gateway APIs. The
application uses AWS Lambda as a backend. The company needs to test the code in a dedicated,
monitored test environment before the company releases the code to the production environment.
When solution will meet these requirements?
A. Use a single stage in API Gateway. Create a Lambda function for each environment. Configure API
clients to send a query parameter that indicates the endowment and the specific lambda function.
B. Use multiple stages in API Gateway. Create a single Lambda function for all environments. Add
different code blocks for different environments in the Lambda function based on Lambda
environments variables.
C. Use multiple stages in API Gateway. Create a Lambda function for each environment. Configure
API Gateway stage variables to route traffic to the Lambda function in different environments.
D. Use a single stage in API Gateway. Configure a API client to send a query parameter that indicated

the environment. Add different code blocks tor afferent environments in the Lambda Junction to
match the value of the query parameter.
Answer: C
Explanation:
The solution that will meet the requirements is to use multiple stages in API Gateway. Create a
Lambda function for each environment. Configure API Gateway stage variables to route traffic to the
Lambda function in different environments. This way, the company can test the code in a dedicated,
monitored test environment before releasing it to the production environment. The company can
also use stage variables to specify the Lambda function version or alias for each stage, and avoid
hard-coding the Lambda function name in the API Gateway integration. The other options either
involve using a single stage in API Gateway, which does not allow testing in different environments,
or adding different code blocks for different environments in the Lambda function, which increases
complexity and maintenance.

QUESTION 77
A developer is planning to migrate on-premises company data to Amazon S3. The data must be
encrypted, and the encryption Keys must support automate annual rotation. The company must use
AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) to encrypt the data.
When type of keys should the developer use to meet these requirements?
A. Amazon S3 managed keys
B. Symmetric customer managed keys with key material that is generated by AWS
C. Asymmetric customer managed keys with key material that generated by AWS
D. Symmetric customer managed keys with imported key material
Answer: B
Explanation:
The type of keys that the developer should use to meet the requirements is symmetric customer
managed keys with key material that is generated by AWS. This way, the developer can use AWS Key
Management Service (AWS KMS) to encrypt the data with a symmetric key that is managed by the
developer. The developer can also enable automatic annual rotation for the key, which creates new
key material for the key every year. The other options either involve using Amazon S3 managed keys,
which do not support automatic annual rotation, or using asymmetric keys or imported key material,
which are not supported by S3 encryption.

QUESTION 78
A team of developed is using an AWS CodePipeline pipeline as a continuous integration and

continuous delivery (CI/CD) mechanism for a web application. A developer has written unit tests to
programmatically test the functionality of the application code. The unit tests produce a test report
that shows the results of each individual check. The developer now wants to run these tests
automatically during the CI/CD process.
A. Write a Git pre-commit hook that runs the test before every commit. Ensure that each developer
who is working on the project has the pre-commit hook instated locally. Review the test report and
resolve any issues before pushing changes to AWS CodeCommit.
B. Add a new stage to the pipeline. Use AWS CodeBuild as the provider. Add the new stage after the
stage that deploys code revisions to the test environment. Write a buildspec that fails the CodeBuild
stage if any test does not pass. Use the test reports feature of Codebuild to integrate the report with
the CodoBuild console. View the test results in CodeBuild Resolve any issues.
C. Add a new stage to the pipeline. Use AWS CodeBuild at the provider. Add the new stage before the
stage that deploys code revisions to the test environment. Write a buildspec that fails the CodeBuild
stage it any test does not pass. Use the test reports feature of CodeBuild to integrate the report with
the CodeBuild console. View the test results in codeBuild Resolve any issues.
D. Add a new stage to the pipeline. Use Jenkins as the provider. Configure CodePipeline to use
Jenkins to run the unit tests. Write a Jenkinsfile that fails the stage if any test does not pass. Use the
test report plugin for Jenkins to integrate the repot with the Jenkins dashboard. View the test results
in Jenkins. Resolve any issues.
Answer: C
Explanation:
The solution that will meet the requirements is to add a new stage to the pipeline. Use AWS
CodeBuild as the provider. Add the new stage before the stage that deploys code revisions to the test
environment. Write a buildspec that fails the CodeBuild stage if any test does not pass. Use the test
reports feature of CodeBuild to integrate the report with the CodeBuild console. View the test results
in CodeBuild. Resolve any issues. This way, the developer can run the unit tests automatically during
the CI/CD process and catch any bugs before deploying to the test environment. The developer can
also use the test reports feature of CodeBuild to view and analyze the test results in a graphical
interface. The other options either involve running the tests manually, running them after
deployment, or using a different provider that requires additional configuration and integration.

QUESTION 79
A company has multiple Amazon VPC endpoints in the same VPC. A developer needs configure an
Amazon S3 bucket policy so users can access an S3 bucket only by using these VPC endpoints.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A. Create multiple S3 bucket polices by using each VPC endpoint ID that have the aws SourceVpce
value in the StringNotEquals condition.

B. Create a single S3 bucket policy that has the aws SourceVpc value and in the StingNotEquals
condition to use VPC ID.
C. Create a single S3 bucket policy that the multiple aws SourceVpce value and in the SringNotEquals
condton to use vpce.
D. Create a single S3 bucket policy that has multiple aws sourceVpce value in the StingNotEquale
condition. Repeat for all the VPC endpoint IDs.
Answer: D
Explanation:
This solution will meet the requirements by creating a single S3 bucket policy that denies access to
the S3 bucket unless the request comes from one of the specified VPC endpoints. The
aws:SourceVpce condition key is used to match the ID of the VPC endpoint that is used to access the
S3 bucket. The StringNotEquals condition operator is used to negate the condition, so that only
requests from the listed VPC endpoints are allowed. Option A is not optimal because it will create
multiple S3 bucket policies, which is not possible as only one bucket policy can be attached to an S3
bucket. Option B is not optimal because it will use the aws:SourceVpc condition key, which matches
the ID of the VPC that is used to access the S3 bucket, not the VPC endpoint. Option C is not optimal
because it will use the StringNotEquals condition operator with a single value, which will deny access
to the S3 bucket from all VPC endpoints except one.

QUESTION 80
A company uses a custom root certificate authority certificate chain (Root CA Cert) that is 10 KB in
size generate SSL certificates for its on-premises HTTPS endpoints. One of the companys cloud based
applications has hundreds of AWS Lambda functions that pull date from these endpoints. A
developer updated the trust store of the Lambda execution environment to use the Root CA Cert
when the Lambda execution environment is initialized. The developer bundled the Root CA Cert as a
text file in the Lambdas deployment bundle.
After 3 months of development the root CA Cert is no longer valid and must be updated. The
developer needs a more efficient solution to update the Root CA Cert for all deployed Lambda
functions. The solution must not include rebuilding or updating all Lambda functions that use the
Root CA Cert. The solution must also work for all development, testing and production environment.
Each environment is managed in a separate AWS account.
When combination of steps Would the developer take to meet these environments MOST costeffectively?
(Select TWO)
A. Store the Root CA Cert as a secret in AWS Secrets Manager. Create a resource-based policy. Add
IAM users to allow access to the secret
B. Store the Root CA Cert as a Secure Sting parameter in aws Systems Manager Parameter Store
Create a resource-based policy. Add IAM users to allow access to the policy.
C. Store the Root CA Cert in an Amazon S3 bucket. Create a resource- based policy to allow access to

the bucket.
D. Refactor the Lambda code to load the Root CA Cert from the Root CA Certs location. Modify the
runtime trust store inside the Lambda function handler.
E. Refactor the Lambda code to load the Root CA Cert from the Root CA Cert's location. Modify the
runtime trust store outside the Lambda function handler.
Answer: BE
Explanation:
This solution will meet the requirements by storing the Root CA Cert as a Secure String parameter in
AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store, which is a secure and scalable service for storing and
managing configuration data and secrets. The resource-based policy will allow IAM users in different
AWS accounts and environments to access the parameter without requiring cross-account roles or
permissions. The Lambda code will be refactored to load the Root CA Cert from the parameter store
and modify the runtime trust store outside the Lambda function handler, which will improve
performance and reduce latency by avoiding repeated calls to Parameter Store and trust store
modifications for each invocation of the Lambda function. Option A is not optimal because it will use
AWS Secrets Manager instead of AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store, which will incur additional
costs and complexity for storing and managing a non-secret configuration data such as Root CA Cert.
Option C is not optimal because it will deactivate the application secrets and monitor the application
error logs temporarily, which will cause application downtime and potential data loss. Option D is not
optimal because it will modify the runtime trust store inside the Lambda function handler, which will
degrade performance and increase latency by repeating unnecessary operations for each invocation
of the Lambda function.

QUESTION 81
A developer maintains applications that store several secrets in AWS Secrets Manager. The
applications use secrets that have changed over time. The developer needs to identify required
secrets that are still in use. The developer does not want to cause any application downtime.
What should the developer do to meet these requirements?
A. Configure an AWS CloudTrail log file delivery to an Amazon S3 bucket. Create an Amazon
CloudWatch alarm for the GetSecretValue. Secrets Manager API operation requests
B. Create a secrets manager-secret-unused AWS Config managed rule. Create an Amazon
EventBridge rule to Initiate notification when the AWS Config managed rule is met.
C. Deactivate the applications secrets and monitor the applications error logs temporarily.
D. Configure AWS X-Ray for the applications. Create a sampling rule lo match the GetSecretValue
Secrets Manager API operation requests.
Answer: B

Explanation:
This solution will meet the requirements by using AWS Config to monitor and evaluate whether
Secrets Manager secrets are unused or have been deleted, based on specified time periods. The
secrets manager-secret-unused managed rule is a predefined rule that checks whether Secrets
Manager secrets have been rotated within a specified number of days or have been deleted within a
specified number of days after last accessed date. The Amazon EventBridge rule will trigger a
notification when the AWS Config managed rule is met, alerting the developer about unused secrets
that can be removed without causing application downtime. Option A is not optimal because it will
use AWS CloudTrail log file delivery to an Amazon S3 bucket, which will incur additional costs and
complexity for storing and analyzing log files that may not contain relevant information about secret
usage. Option C is not optimal because it will deactivate the application secrets and monitor the
application error logs temporarily, which will cause application downtime and potential data loss.
Option D is not optimal because it will use AWS X-Ray to trace secret usage, which will introduce
additional overhead and latency for instrumenting and sampling requests that may not be related to
secret usage.

QUESTION 82
A developer is writing a serverless application that requires an AWS Lambda function to be invoked
every 10 minutes.
What is an automated and serverless way to invoke the function?
A. Deploy an Amazon EC2 instance based on Linux, and edit its /etc/confab file by adding a command
to periodically invoke the lambda function
B. Configure an environment variable named PERIOD for the Lambda function. Set the value to 600.
C. Create an Amazon EventBridge rule that runs on a regular schedule to invoke the Lambda
function.
D. Create an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic that has a subscription to the
Lambda function with a 600-second timer.
Answer: C
Explanation:
The solution that will meet the requirements is to create an Amazon EventBridge rule that runs on a
regular schedule to invoke the Lambda function. This way, the developer can use an automated and
serverless way to invoke the function every 10 minutes. The developer can also use a cron expression
or a rate expression to specify the schedule for the rule. The other options either involve using an
Amazon EC2 instance, which is not serverless, or using environment variables or query parameters,
which do not trigger the function.

B. Deploy AWS X-Ray as a daemon set to the Fargate cluster. Update the service role policy to allow
access to the X-Ray API.
C. Instrument the application by using the AWS X-Ray SDK. Update the application to use the Put-
XrayTrace API call to communicate with the X-Ray API.
D. Instrument the application by using the AWS X-Ray SDK. Update the application to communicate
with the X-Ray daemon.
E. Instrument the ECS task to send the stout and spider- output to Amazon CloudWatch Logs. Update
the task role policy to allow the cloudwatch Putlogs action.
Answer: A, E
Explanation:
The combination of steps that the developer should take to fix the errors is to deploy AWS X-Ray as a
sidecar container to the microservices and instrument the ECS task to send the stdout and stderr
output to Amazon CloudWatch Logs. This way, the developer can use AWS X-Ray to analyze and
debug the performance of the microservices and identify any issues or bottlenecks. The developer
can also use CloudWatch Logs to monitor and troubleshoot the logs from the ECS task and detect any
errors or exceptions. The other options either involve using AWS X-Ray as a daemon set, which is not
supported by Fargate, or using the PutTraceSegments API call, which is not necessary when using a
sidecar container.

QUESTION 84
A company is using Amazon OpenSearch Service to implement an audit monitoring system. A
developer needs to create an AWS Cloudformation custom resource that is associated with an AWS
Lambda function to configure the OpenSearch Service domain. The Lambda function must access the
OpenSearch Service domain by using Open Search Service internal master user credentials.
What is the MOST secure way to pass these credentials to the Lambdas function?
A. Use a CloudFormation parameter to pass the master user credentials at deployment to the
OpenSearch Service domain's MasterUserOptions and the Lambda function's environment variable.
Set the No Echo attenuate to true.
B. Use a CloudFormation parameter to pass the master user credentials at deployment to the
OpenSearch Service domain's MasterUserOptions and to create a parameter. In AWS Systems
Manager Parameter Store. Set the No Echo attribute to true. Create an 1AM role that has the ssm

GetParameter permission. Assign me role to the Lambda function. Store me parameter name as the
Lambda function's environment variable. Resolve the parameter's value at runtime.
C. Use a CloudFormation parameter to pass the master uses credentials at deployment to the
OpenSearch Service domain's MasterUserOptions and the Lambda function's environment varleWe
Encrypt the parameters value by using the AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) encrypt
command.
D. Use CloudFoimalion to create an AWS Secrets Manager Secret. Use a CloudFormation dynamic
reference to retrieve the secret's value for the OpenSearch Service domain's MasterUserOptions.
Create an 1AM role that has the secrets manager. GetSecretvalue permission. Assign the role to the
Lambda Function Store the secrets name as the Lambda function's environment variable. Resole the
secret's value at runtime.
Answer: D
Explanation:
The solution that will meet the requirements is to use CloudFormation to create an AWS Secrets
Manager secret. Use a CloudFormation dynamic reference to retrieve the secrets value for the
OpenSearch Service domains MasterUserOptions. Create an IAM role that has the
secretsmanager:GetSecretValue permission. Assign the role to the Lambda function. Store the
secrets name as the Lambda functions environment variable. Resolve the secrets value at runtime.
This way, the developer can pass the credentials to the Lambda function in a secure way, as AWS
Secrets Manager encrypts and manages the secrets. The developer can also use a dynamic reference
to avoid exposing the secrets value in plain text in the CloudFormation template. The other options
either involve passing the credentials as plain text parameters, which is not secure, or encrypting
them with AWS KMS, which is less convenient than using AWS Secrets Manager.

QUESTION 85
An application runs on multiple EC2 instances behind an ELB.
Where is the session data best written so that it can be served reliably across multiple requests?
A. Write data to Amazon ElastiCache
B. Write data to Amazon Elastic Block Store
C. Write data to Amazon EC2 instance Store
D. Wide data to the root filesystem
Answer: A
Explanation:
The solution that will meet the requirements is to write data to Amazon ElastiCache. This way, the
application can write session data to a fast, scalable, and reliable in-memory data store that can be
served reliably across multiple requests. The other options either involve writing data to persistent

storage, which is slower and more expensive than in-memory storage, or writing data to the root
filesystem, which is not shared among multiple EC2 instances.

QUESTION 86
An ecommerce application is running behind an Application Load Balancer. A developer observes
some unexpected load on the application during non-peak hours. The developer wants to analyze
patterns for the client IP addresses that use the application. Which HTTP header should the
developer use for this analysis?
A. The X-Forwarded-Proto header
B. The X-F Forwarded-Host header
C. The X-Forwarded-For header
D. The X-Forwarded-Port header
Answer: C
Explanation:
The HTTP header that the developer should use for this analysis is the X-Forwarded-For header. This
header contains the IP address of the client that made the request to the Application Load Balancer.
The developer can use this header to analyze patterns for the client IP addresses that use the
application. The other headers either contain information about the protocol, host, or port of the
request, which are not relevant for the analysis.

QUESTION 87
A developer migrated a legacy application to an AWS Lambda function. The function uses a thirdparty
service to pull data with a series of API calls at the end of each month. The function than
processes the data to generate the monthly reports. The function has Been working with no issues so
far.
The third-party service recently issued a restriction to allow a feed number to API calls each minute
and each day. If the API calls exceed the limit tor each minute or each day, then the service will
produce errors. The API also provides the minute limit and daily limit in the response header. This
restriction might extend the overall process to multiple days because the process is consuming more
API calls than the available limit.
What is the MOST operationally efficient way to refactor the server less application to accommodate
this change?
A. Use an AWS Step Functions State machine to monitor API failures. Use the Wait state to delay
calling the Lambda function.
B. Use an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue to hold the API calls. Configure the
Lambda function to poll the queue within the API threshold limits.

C. Use an Amazon CloudWatch Logs metric to count the number of API calls. Configure an Amazon
CloudWatch alarm flat slops the currently running instance of the Lambda function when the metric
exceeds the API threshold limits.
D. Use Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose to batch me API calls and deliver them to an Amazon S3 bucket
win an event notification to invoke the Lambda function.
Answer: A
Explanation:
The solution that will meet the requirements is to use an AWS Step Functions state machine to
monitor API failures. Use the Wait state to delay calling the Lambda function. This way, the developer
can refactor the serverless application to accommodate the change in a way that is automated and
scalable. The developer can use Step Functions to orchestrate the Lambda function and handle any
errors or retries. The developer can also use the Wait state to pause the execution for a specified
duration or until a specified timestamp, which can help avoid exceeding the API limits. The other
options either involve using additional services that are not necessary or appropriate for this
scenario, or do not address the issue of API failures.

QUESTION 88
A developer must analyze performance issues with production-distributed applications written as
AWS Lambda functions. These distributed Lambda applications invoke other components that make
up me applications. How should the developer identify and troubleshoot the root cause of the
performance issues in production?
A. Add logging statements to the Lambda functions. then use Amazon CloudWatch to view the logs.
B. Use AWS CloudTrail and then examine the logs.
C. Use AWS X-Ray. then examine the segments and errors.
D. Run Amazon inspector agents and then analyze performance.
Answer: C
Explanation:
This solution will meet the requirements by using AWS X-Ray to analyze and debug the performance
issues with the distributed Lambda applications. AWS X-Ray is a service that collects data about
requests that the applications serve, and provides tools to view, filter, and gain insights into that
data. The developer can use AWS X-Ray to identify the root cause of the performance issues by
examining the segments and errors that show the details of each request and the components that
make up the applications. Option A is not optimal because it will use logging statements and Amazon
CloudWatch, which may not provide enough information or visibility into the distributed
applications. Option B is not optimal because it will use AWS CloudTrail, which is a service that
records API calls and events for AWS services, not application performance data. Option D is not

optimal because it will use Amazon Inspector, which is a service that helps improve the security and
compliance of applications on Amazon EC2 instances, not Lambda functions.

QUESTION 89
A developer wants to deploy a new version of an AWS Elastic Beanstalk application. During
deployment the application must maintain full capacity and avoid service interruption. Additionally,
the developer must minimize the cost of additional resources that support the deployment.
Which deployment method should the developer use to meet these requirements?
A. All at once
B. Rolling with additional batch
C. Bluegreen
D. Immutable
Answer: B
Explanation:
This solution will meet the requirements by using a rolling with additional batch deployment
method, which deploys the new version of the application to a separate group of instances and then
shifts traffic to those instances in batches. This way, the application maintains full capacity and avoids
service interruption during deployment, as well as minimizes the cost of additional resources that
support the deployment. Option A is not optimal because it will use an all at once deployment
method, which deploys the new version of the application to all instances simultaneously, which may
cause service interruption or downtime during deployment. Option C is not optimal because it will
use a blue/green deployment method, which deploys the new version of the application to a
separate environment and then swaps URLs with the original environment, which may incur more
costs for additional resources that support the deployment. Option D is not optimal because it will
use an immutable deployment method, which deploys the new version of the application to a fresh
group of instances and then redirects traffic to those instances, which may also incur more costs for
additional resources that support the deployment.

QUESTION 90
A developer has observed an increase in bugs in the AWS Lambda functions that a development
team has deployed in its Node is application. To minimize these bugs, the developer wants to
impendent automated testing of Lambda functions in an environment that Closely simulates the
Lambda environment.
The developer needs to give other developers the ability to run the tests locally. The developer also
needs to integrate the tests into the team's continuous integration and continuous delivery (Ct/CO)
pipeline before the AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS COK) deployment.
Which solution will meet these requirements?

A. Create sample events based on the Lambda documentation. Create automated test scripts that
use the cdk local invoke command to invoke the Lambda functions. Check the response Document
the test scripts for the other developers on the team Update the CI/CD pipeline to run the test
scripts.
B. Install a unit testing framework that reproduces the Lambda execution environment. Create
sample events based on the Lambda Documentation Invoke the handler function by using a unit
testing framework. Check the response Document how to run the unit testing framework for the
other developers on the team. Update the OCD pipeline to run the unit testing framework.
C. Install the AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAW) CLI tool Use the Sam local generateevent
command to generate sample events for me automated tests. Create automated test scripts
that use the Sam local invoke command to invoke the Lambda functions. Check the response
Document the test scripts tor the other developers on the team Update the CI/CD pipeline to run the
test scripts.
D. Create sample events based on the Lambda documentation. Create a Docker container from the
Node is base image to invoke the Lambda functions. Check the response Document how to run the
Docker container for the more developers on the team update the CI/CD pipeline to run the Docker
container.
Answer: C
Explanation:
This solution will meet the requirements by using AWS SAM CLI tool, which is a command line tool
that lets developers locally build, test, debug, and deploy serverless applications defined by AWS
SAM templates. The developer can use sam local generate-event command to generate sample
events for different event sources such as API Gateway or S3. The developer can create automated
test scripts that use sam local invoke command to invoke Lambda functions locally in an environment
that closely simulates Lambda environment. The developer can check the response from Lambda
functions and document how to run the test scripts for other developers on the team. The developer
can also update CI/CD pipeline to run these test scripts before deploying with AWS CDK. Option A is
not optimal because it will use cdk local invoke command, which does not exist in AWS CDK CLI tool.
Option B is not optimal because it will use a unit testing framework that reproduces Lambda
execution environment, which may not be accurate or consistent with Lambda environment. Option
D is not optimal because it will create a Docker container from Node.js base image to invoke Lambda
functions, which may introduce additional overhead and complexity for creating and running Docker
containers.

QUESTION 92
A developer needs to store configuration variables for an application. The developer needs to set an
expiration date and time for me configuration. The developer wants to receive notifications. Before
the configuration expires. Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational
overhead?
A. Create a standard parameter in AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store Set Expiation and
Expiration Notification policy types.
B. Create a standard parameter in AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store Create an AWS Lambda
function to expire the configuration and to send Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS)
notifications.

C. Create an advanced parameter in AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store Set Expiration and
Expiration Notification policy types.
D. Create an advanced parameter in AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store Create an Amazon EC2
instance with a corn job to expire the configuration and to send notifications.
Answer: C
Explanation:
This solution will meet the requirements by creating an advanced parameter in AWS Systems
Manager Parameter Store, which is a secure and scalable service for storing and managing
configuration data and secrets. The advanced parameter allows setting expiration and expiration
notification policy types, which enable specifying an expiration date and time for the configuration
and receiving notifications before the configuration expires. The Lambda code will be refactored to
load the Root CA Cert from the parameter store and modify the runtime trust store outside the
Lambda function handler, which will improve performance and reduce latency by avoiding repeated
calls to Parameter Store and trust store modifications for each invocation of the Lambda function.
Option A is not optimal because it will create a standard parameter in AWS Systems Manager
Parameter Store, which does not support expiration and expiration notification policy types. Option B
is not optimal because it will create a secret access key and access key ID with permission to access
the S3 bucket, which will introduce additional security risks and complexity for storing and managing
credentials. Option D is not optimal because it will create a Docker container from Node.js base
image to invoke Lambda functions, which will incur additional costs and overhead for creating and
running Docker containers.

QUESTION 93
When using the AWS Encryption SDK how does the developer keep track of the data encryption keys
used to encrypt data?
A. The developer must manually keep Hack of the data encryption keys used for each data object.
B. The SDK encrypts the data encryption key and stores it (encrypted) as part of the resumed
ophertext.
C. The SDK stores the data encryption keys automaticity in Amazon S3.
D. The data encryption key is stored m the user data for the EC2 instance.
Answer: B
Explanation:
This solution will meet the requirements by using AWS Encryption SDK, which is a client-side
encryption library that enables developers to encrypt and decrypt data using data encryption keys
that are protected by AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS). The SDK encrypts the data

encryption key with a customer master key (CMK) that is managed by AWS KMS, and stores it
(encrypted) as part of the returned ciphertext. The developer does not need to keep track of the data
encryption keys used to encrypt data, as they are stored with the encrypted data and can be
retrieved and decrypted by using AWS KMS when needed. Option A is not optimal because it will
require manual tracking of the data encryption keys used for each data object, which is error-prone
and inefficient. Option C is not optimal because it will store the data encryption keys automatically in
Amazon S3, which is unnecessary and insecure as Amazon S3 is not designed for storing encryption
keys. Option D is not optimal because it will store the data encryption key in the user data for the EC2
instance, which is also unnecessary and insecure as user data is not encrypted by default.
Reference: [AWS Encryption SDK], [AWS Key Management Service]
QUESTION 94
An application that runs on AWS Lambda requires access to specific highly confidential objects in an
Amazon S3 bucket. In accordance with the principle of least privilege a company grants access to the
S3 bucket by using only temporary credentials.
How can a developer configure access to the S3 bucket in the MOST secure way?
A. Hardcode the credentials that are required to access the S3 objects in the application code. Use
the credentials to access me required S3 objects.
B. Create a secret access key and access key ID with permission to access the S3 bucket. Store the key
and key ID in AWS Secrets Manager. Configure the application to retrieve the Secrets Manager secret
and use the credentials to access me S3 objects.
C. Create a Lambda function execution role Attach a policy to the rote that grants access to specific
objects in the S3 bucket.
D. Create a secret access key and access key ID with permission to access the S3 bucket Store the key
and key ID as environment variables m Lambda. Use the environment variables to access the
required S3 objects.
Answer: C
Explanation:
This solution will meet the requirements by creating a Lambda function execution role, which is an
IAM role that grants permissions to a Lambda function to access AWS resources such as Amazon S3
objects. The developer can attach a policy to the role that grants access to specific objects in the S3
bucket that are required by the application, following the principle of least privilege. Option A is not
optimal because it will hardcode the credentials that are required to access S3 objects in the
application code, which is insecure and difficult to maintain. Option B is not optimal because it will
create a secret access key and access key ID with permission to access the S3 bucket, which will
introduce additional security risks and complexity for storing and managing credentials. Option D is
not optimal because it will store the secret access key and access key ID as environment variables in
Lambda, which is also insecure and difficult to maintain.
Reference: [AWS Lambda Execution Role], [Using AWS Lambda with Amazon S3]

QUESTION 95
A developer has code that is stored in an Amazon S3 bucket. The code must be deployed as an AWS
Lambda function across multiple accounts in the same AWS Region as the S3 bucket an AWS
CloudPormation template that runs for each account will deploy the Lambda function.
What is the MOST secure way to allow CloudFormaton to access the Lambda Code in the S3 bucket?
A. Grant the CloudFormation service role the S3 ListBucket and GetObject permissions. Add a bucket
policy to Amazon S3 with the principal of "AWS" (account numbers)
B. Grant the CloudFormation service row the S3 GetObfect permission. Add a Bucket policy to
Amazon S3 with the principal of "'"
C. Use a service-based link to grant the Lambda function the S3 ListBucket and GetObject
permissions by explicitly adding the S3 bucket's account number in the resource.
D. Use a service-based link to grant the Lambda function the S3 GetObject permission Add a resource
of "** to allow access to the S3 bucket.
Answer: B
Explanation:
This solution allows the CloudFormation service role to access the S3 bucket from any account, as
long as it has the S3 GetObject permission. The bucket policy grants access to any principal with the
GetObject permission, which is the least privilege needed to deploy the Lambda code. This is more
secure than granting ListBucket permission, which is not required for deploying Lambda code, or
using a service-based link, which is not supported for Lambda functions.

QUESTION 96
A developer warns to add request validation to a production environment Amazon API Gateway API.
The developer needs to test the changes before the API is deployed to the production environment.
For the lest the developer will send test requests to the API through a testing tool.
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?
A. Export the existing API to an OpenAPI file. Create a new API Import the OpenAPI file Modify the
new API to add request validation. Perform the tests Modify the existing API to add request
validation. Deploy the existing API to production.
B. Modify the existing API to add request validation. Deploy the updated API to a new API Gateway
stage Perform the tests Deploy the updated API to the API Gateway production stage.
C. Create a new API Add the necessary resources and methods including new request validation.
Perform the tests Modify the existing API to add request validation. Deploy the existing API to
production.
D. Clone the exiting API Modify the new API lo add request validation. Perform the tests Modify the
existing API to add request validation Deploy the existing API to production.

Answer: D
Explanation:
This solution allows the developer to test the changes without affecting the production environment.
Cloning an API creates a copy of the API definition that can be modified independently. The
developer can then add request validation to the new API and test it using a testing tool. After
verifying that the changes work as expected, the developer can apply the same changes to the
existing API and deploy it to production.
Reference: Clone an API, [Enable Request Validation for an API in API Gateway]
QUESTION 97
A developer at a company needs to create a small application mat makes the same API call once
each flay at a designated time. The company does not have infrastructure in the AWS Cloud yet, but
the company wants to implement this functionality on AWS.
Which solution meets these requirements in the MOST operationally efficient manner?
A. Use a Kubermetes cron job that runs on Amazon Elastic Kubemetes Sen/ice (Amazon EKS)
B. Use an Amazon Linux crontab scheduled job that runs on Amazon EC2
C. Use an AWS Lambda function that is invoked by an Amazon EventBridge scheduled event.
D. Use an AWS Batch job that is submitted to an AWS Batch job queue.
Answer: C
Explanation:
This solution meets the requirements in the most operationally efficient manner because it does not
require any infrastructure provisioning or management. The developer can create a Lambda function
that makes the API call and configure an EventBridge rule that triggers the function once a day at a
designated time. This is a serverless solution that scales automatically and only charges for the
execution time of the function.
Reference: [Using AWS Lambda with Amazon EventBridge], [Schedule Expressions for Rules]
QUESTION 98
A developer is building a serverless application that is based on AWS Lambd
a. The developer initializes the AWS software development kit (SDK) outside of the Lambda handcar
function.
What is the PRIMARY benefit of this action?
A. Improves legibility and systolic convention
B. Takes advantage of runtime environment reuse
C. Provides better error handling
D. Creates a new SDK instance for each invocation

Answer: B
Explanation:
This benefit occurs when initializing the AWS SDK outside of the Lambda handler function because it
allows the SDK instance to be reused across multiple invocations of the same function. This can
improve performance and reduce latency by avoiding unnecessary initialization overhead. If the SDK
is initialized inside the handler function, it will create a new SDK instance for each invocation, which
can increase memory usage and execution time.

QUESTION 99
A company is using Amazon RDS as the Backend database for its application. After a recent marketing
campaign, a surge of read requests to the database increased the latency of data retrieval from the
database.
The company has decided to implement a caching layer in front of the database. The cached content
must be encrypted and must be highly available.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A. Amazon Cloudfront
B. Amazon ElastiCache to Memcached
C. Amazon ElastiCache for Redis in cluster mode
D. Amazon DynamoDB Accelerate (DAX)
Answer: C
Explanation:
This solution meets the requirements because it provides a caching layer that can store and retrieve
encrypted data from multiple nodes. Amazon ElastiCache for Redis supports encryption at rest and in
transit, and can scale horizontally to increase the cache capacity and availability. Amazon ElastiCache
for Memcached does not support encryption, Amazon CloudFront is a content delivery network that
is not suitable for caching database queries, and Amazon DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) is a caching
service that only works with DynamoDB tables.
Reference: [Amazon ElastiCache for Redis Features], [Choosing a Cluster Engine]
QUESTION 100
A developer at a company recently created a serverless application to process and show data from
business reports. The application's user interface (UI) allows users to select and start processing the
files. The Ul displays a message when the result is available to view. The application uses AWS Step
Functions with AWS Lambda functions to process the files. The developer used Amazon API Gateway
and Lambda functions to create an API to support the UI.

The company's Ul team reports that the request to process a file is often returning timeout errors
because of the see or complexity of the files. The Ul team wants the API to provide an immediate
response so that the Ul can deploy a message while the files are being processed. The backend
process that is invoked by the API needs to send an email message when the report processing is
complete.
What should the developer do to configure the API to meet these requirements?
A. Change the API Gateway route to add an X-Amz-Invocation-Type header win a sialic value of
'Event' in the integration request Deploy the API Gateway stage to apply the changes.
B. Change the configuration of the Lambda function that implements the request to process a file.
Configure the maximum age of the event so that the Lambda function will ion asynchronously.
C. Change the API Gateway timeout value to match the Lambda function ominous value. Deploy the
API Gateway stage to apply the changes.
D. Change the API Gateway route to add an X-Amz-Target header with a static value of 'A sync' in the
integration request Deploy me API Gateway stage to apply the changes.
Answer: A
Explanation:
This solution allows the API to invoke the Lambda function asynchronously, which means that the API
will return an immediate response without waiting for the function to complete. The X-Amz-
Invocation-Type header specifies the invocation type of the Lambda function, and setting it to ˜Event
means that the function will be invoked asynchronously. The function can then use Amazon Simple
Email Service (SES) to send an email message when the report processing is complete.
Reference: [Asynchronous invocation], [Set up Lambda proxy integrations in API Gateway]
QUESTION 101
A developer has an application that is composed of many different AWS Lambda functions. The
Lambda functions all use some of the same dependencies. To avoid security issues the developer is
constantly updating the dependencies of all of the Lambda functions. The result is duplicated effort
to reach function.
How can the developer keep the dependencies of the Lambda functions up to date with the LEAST
additional complexity?
A. Define a maintenance window for the Lambda functions to ensure that the functions get updated
copies of the dependencies.
B. Upgrade the Lambda functions to the most recent runtime version.
C. Define a Lambda layer that contains all of the shared dependencies.
D. Use an AWS CodeCommit repository to host the dependencies in a centralized location.
Answer: C

Explanation:
This solution allows the developer to keep the dependencies of the Lambda functions up to date
with the least additional complexity because it eliminates the need to update each function
individually. A Lambda layer is a ZIP archive that contains libraries, custom runtimes, or other
dependencies. The developer can create a layer that contains all of the shared dependencies and
attach it to multiple Lambda functions. When the developer updates the layer, all of the functions
that use the layer will have access to the latest version of the dependencies.
Reference: [AWS Lambda layers]
QUESTION 102
A mobile app stores blog posts in an Amazon DynacnoDB table Millions of posts are added every day
and each post represents a single item in the table. The mobile app requires only recent posts. Any
post that is older than 48 hours can be removed.
What is the MOST cost-effective way to delete posts that are older man 48 hours?
A. For each item add a new attribute of type String that has a timestamp that is set to the blog post
creation time. Create a script to find old posts with a table scan and remove posts that are order than
48 hours by using the Balch Write ltem API operation. Schedule a cron job on an Amazon EC2
instance once an hour to start the script.
B. For each item add a new attribute of type. String that has a timestamp that its set to the blog post
creation time. Create a script to find old posts with a table scan and remove posts that are Oder than
48 hours by using the Batch Write item API operating. Place the script in a container image. Schedule
an Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) task on AWS Far gate that invokes the container
every 5 minutes.
C. For each item, add a new attribute of type Date that has a timestamp that is set to 48 hours after
the blog post creation time. Create a global secondary index (GSI) that uses the new attribute as a
sort key. Create an AWS Lambda function that references the GSI and removes expired items by using
the Batch Write item API operation Schedule me function with an Amazon CloudWatch event every
minute.
D. For each item add a new attribute of type. Number that has timestamp that is set to 48 hours after
the blog post. creation time Configure the DynamoDB table with a TTL that references the new
attribute.
Answer: D
Explanation:
This solution will meet the requirements by using the Time to Live (TTL) feature of DynamoDB, which
enables automatically deleting items from a table after a certain time period. The developer can add
a new attribute of type Number that has a timestamp that is set to 48 hours after the blog post
creation time, which represents the expiration time of the item. The developer can configure the
DynamoDB table with a TTL that references the new attribute, which instructs DynamoDB to delete
the item when the current time is greater than or equal to the expiration time. This solution is also

cost-effective as it does not incur any additional charges for deleting expired items. Option A is not
optimal because it will create a script to find and remove old posts with a table scan and a batch
write item API operation, which may consume more read and write capacity units and incur more
costs. Option B is not optimal because it will use Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) and
AWS Fargate to run the script, which may introduce additional costs and complexity for managing
and scaling containers. Option C is not optimal because it will create a global secondary index (GSI)
that uses the expiration time as a sort key, which may consume more storage space and incur more
costs.

password database, host, and port. Store the DynamoDB table. S3 bucket, and SNS topic in Amazon
S3 Create a Lambda function and set the logic for the credentials rotation Invoke the Lambda
function on a schedule.
Answer: B
Explanation:
This solution will meet the requirements by using AWS Secrets Manager and AWS Systems Manager
Parameter Store to securely store the parameter values outside the code in an encrypted format.
AWS Secrets Manager is a service that helps protect secrets such as database credentials by

encrypting them with AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) and enabling automatic rotation of
secrets. The developer can create an RDS database secret in AWS Secrets Manager and set the user
name, password, database, host, and port for accessing the RDS database. The developer can also
turn on secret rotation, which will change the database credentials periodically according to a
specified schedule or event. AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store is a service that provides secure
and scalable storage for configuration data and secrets. The developer can create Secure String
parameters in AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store for the DynamoDB table, S3 bucket, and SNS
topic, which will encrypt them with AWS KMS. The developer can also reuse the parameter values
from other applications and update them without modifying code. Option A is not optimal because it
will create encrypted Lambda environment variables for the DynamoDB table, S3 bucket, and SNS
topic, which may not be reusable or updatable without modifying code. Option C is not optimal
because it will create RDS database parameters in AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store, which
does not support automatic rotation of secrets. Option D is not optimal because it will store the
DynamoDB table, S3 bucket, and SNS topic in Amazon S3, which may introduce additional costs and
complexity for accessing configuration data.

QUESTION 104
A developer accesses AWS CodeCommit over SSH. The SSH keys configured to access AWS
CodeCommit are tied to a user with the following permissions:
The developer needs to create/delete branches
Which specific IAM permissions need to be added based on the principle of least privilege?

A. Option A
B. Option B
C. Option C
D. Option D
Answer: A
Explanation:
This solution allows the developer to create and delete branches in AWS CodeCommit by granting
the codecommit:CreateBranch and codecommit:DeleteBranch permissions. These are the minimum
permissions required for this task, following the principle of least privilege. Option B grants too many
permissions, such as codecommit:Put*, which allows the developer to create, update, or delete any
resource in CodeCommit. Option C grants too few permissions, such as codecommit:Update*, which
does not allow the developer to create or delete branches. Option D grants all permissions, such as
codecommit:*, which is not secure or recommended.

QUESTION 105
An application that is deployed to Amazon EC2 is using Amazon DynamoDB. The app cation calls the
DynamoDB REST API Periodically the application receives a
ProvisionedThroughputExceededException error when the application writes to a DynamoDB table.
Which solutions will mitigate this error MOST cost-effectively^ (Select TWO)
A. Modify the application code to perform exponential back off when the error is received.
B. Modify the application to use the AWS SDKs for DynamoDB.
C. Increase the read and write throughput of the DynamoDB table.
D. Create a DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) cluster for the DynamoDB table.
E. Create a second DynamoDB table Distribute the reads and writes between the two tables.
Answer: A, B

Explanation:
These solutions will mitigate the error most cost-effectively because they do not require increasing
the provisioned throughput of the DynamoDB table or creating additional resources. Exponential
backoff is a retry strategy that increases the waiting time between retries to reduce the number of
requests sent to DynamoDB. The AWS SDKs for DynamoDB implement exponential backoff by default
and also provide other features such as automatic pagination and encryption. Increasing the read
and write throughput of the DynamoDB table, creating a DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) cluster, or
creating a second DynamoDB table will incur additional costs and complexity.

QUESTION 106
When a developer tries to run an AWS Code Build project, it raises an error because the length of all
environment variables exceeds the limit for the combined maximum of characters.
What is the recommended solution?
A. Add the export LC-_ALL" on _ US, tuft" command to the pre _ build section to ensure POSIX
Localization.
B. Use Amazon Cognate to store key-value pairs for large numbers of environment variables
C. Update the settings for the build project to use an Amazon S3 bucket for large numbers of
environment variables
D. Use AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store to store large numbers ot environment variables
Answer: D
Explanation:
This solution allows the developer to overcome the limit for the combined maximum of characters
for environment variables in AWS CodeBuild. AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store provides
secure, hierarchical storage for configuration data management and secrets management. The
developer can store large numbers of environment variables as parameters in Parameter Store and
reference them in the buildspec file using parameter references. Adding export LC_ALL=œen_US.utf8
command to the pre_build section will not affect the environment variables limit. Using Amazon
Cognito or an Amazon S3 bucket to store key-value pairs for environment variables will require
additional configuration and integration.

Parameter Store?]
QUESTION 107
A company is expanding the compatibility of its photo-snaring mobile app to hundreds of additional
devices with unique screen dimensions and resolutions. Photos are stored in Amazon S3 in their
original format and resolution. The company uses an Amazon CloudFront distribution to serve the
photos The app includes the dimension and resolution of the display as GET parameters with every
request.

A developer needs to implement a solution that optimizes the photos that are served to each device
to reduce load time and increase photo quality.
Which solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effective?
A. Use S3 Batch Operations to invoke an AWS Lambda function to create new variants of the photos
with the required dimensions and resolutions. Create a dynamic CloudFront origin that automatically
maps the request of each device to the corresponding photo variant.
B. Use S3 Batch Operations to invoke an AWS Lambda function to create new variants of the photos
with the required dimensions and resolutions. Create a Lambda@Edge function to route requests to
the corresponding photo vacant by using request headers.
C. Create a Lambda@Edge function that optimizes the photos upon request and returns the photos
as a response. Change the CloudFront TTL cache policy to the maximum value possible.
D. Create a Lambda@Edge function that optimizes the photos upon request and returns the photos
as a response. In the same function store a copy of the processed photos on Amazon S3 for
subsequent requests.
Answer: D
Explanation:
This solution meets the requirements most cost-effectively because it optimizes the photos on
demand and caches them for future requests. Lambda@Edge allows the developer to run Lambda
functions at AWS locations closer to viewers, which can reduce latency and improve photo quality.
The developer can create a Lambda@Edge function that uses the GET parameters from each request
to optimize the photos with the required dimensions and resolutions and returns them as a
response. The function can also store a copy of the processed photos on Amazon S3 for subsequent
requests, which can reduce processing time and costs. Using S3 Batch Operations to create new
variants of the photos will incur additional storage costs and may not cover all possible dimensions
and resolutions. Creating a dynamic CloudFront origin or a Lambda@Edge function to route requests
to corresponding photo variants will require maintaining a mapping of device types and photo
variants, which can be complex and error-prone.

QUESTION 108
A company is building an application for stock trading. The application needs sub-millisecond latency
for processing trade requests. The company uses Amazon DynamoDB to store all the trading data
that is used to process each trading request A development team performs load testing on the
application and finds that the data retrieval time is higher than expected. The development team
needs a solution that reduces the data retrieval time with the least possible effort.
Which solution meets these requirements'?
A. Add local secondary indexes (LSis) for the trading data.
B. Store the trading data m Amazon S3 and use S3 Transfer Acceleration.

C. Add retries with exponential back off for DynamoDB queries.
D. Use DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) to cache the trading data.
Answer: D
Explanation:
This solution will meet the requirements by using DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX), which is a fully
managed, highly available, in-memory cache for DynamoDB that delivers up to a 10 times
performance improvement - from milliseconds to microseconds - even at millions of requests per
second. The developer can use DAX to cache the trading data that is used to process each trading
request, which will reduce the data retrieval time with the least possible effort. Option A is not
optimal because it will add local secondary indexes (LSIs) for the trading data, which may not
improve the performance or reduce the latency of data retrieval, as LSIs are stored on the same
partition as the base table and share the same provisioned throughput. Option B is not optimal
because it will store the trading data in Amazon S3 and use S3 Transfer Acceleration, which is a
feature that enables fast, easy, and secure transfers of files over long distances between S3 buckets
and clients, not between DynamoDB and clients. Option C is not optimal because it will add retries
with exponential backoff for DynamoDB queries, which is a strategy to handle transient errors by
retrying failed requests with increasing delays, not by reducing data retrieval time.
Reference: [DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX)], [Local Secondary Indexes]
QUESTION 109
A developer is working on a Python application that runs on Amazon EC2 instances. The developer
wants to enable tracing of application requests to debug performance issues in the code.
Which combination of actions should the developer take to achieve this goal? (Select TWO)
A. Install the Amazon CloudWatch agent on the EC2 instances.
B. Install the AWS X-Ray daemon on the EC2 instances.
C. Configure the application to write JSON-formatted togs to /var/log/cloudwatch.
D. Configure the application to write trace data to /Var/log-/xray.
E. Install and configure the AWS X-Ray SDK for Python in the application.
Answer: BE
Explanation:
This solution will meet the requirements by using AWS X-Ray to enable tracing of application
requests to debug performance issues in the code. AWS X-Ray is a service that collects data about
requests that the applications serve, and provides tools to view, filter, and gain insights into that
data. The developer can install the AWS X-Ray daemon on the EC2 instances, which is a software that
listens for traffic on UDP port 2000, gathers raw segment data, and relays it to the X-Ray API. The
developer can also install and configure the AWS X-Ray SDK for Python in the application, which is a
library that enables instrumenting Python code to generate and send trace data to the X-Ray

daemon. Option A is not optimal because it will install the Amazon CloudWatch agent on the EC2
instances, which is a software that collects metrics and logs from EC2 instances and on-premises
servers, not application performance data. Option C is not optimal because it will configure the
application to write JSON-formatted logs to /var/log/cloudwatch, which is not a valid path or
destination for CloudWatch logs. Option D is not optimal because it will configure the application to
write trace data to /var/log/xray, which is also not a valid path or destination for X-Ray trace data.
Reference: [AWS X-Ray], [Running the X-Ray Daemon on Amazon EC2]
QUESTION 110
A company has an application that runs as a series of AWS Lambda functions. Each Lambda function
receives data from an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic and writes the data to
an Amazon Aurora DB instance.
To comply with an information security policy, the company must ensure that the Lambda functions
all use a single securely encrypted database connection string to access Aurora.
Which solution will meet these requirements'?
A. Use IAM database authentication for Aurora to enable secure database connections for ail the
Lambda functions.
B. Store the credentials and read the credentials from an encrypted Amazon RDS DB instance.
C. Store the credentials in AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store as a secure string parameter.
D. Use Lambda environment variables with a shared AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) key
for encryption.
Answer: A
Explanation:
This solution will meet the requirements by using IAM database authentication for Aurora, which
enables using IAM roles or users to authenticate with Aurora databases instead of using passwords
or other secrets. The developer can use IAM database authentication for Aurora to enable secure
database connections for all the Lambda functions that access Aurora DB instance. The developer can
create an IAM role with permission to connect to Aurora DB instance and attach it to each Lambda
function. The developer can also configure Aurora DB instance to use IAM database authentication
and enable encryption in transit using SSL certificates. This way, the Lambda functions can use a
single securely encrypted database connection string to access Aurora without needing any secrets
or passwords. Option B is not optimal because it will store the credentials and read them from an
encrypted Amazon RDS DB instance, which may introduce additional costs and complexity for
managing and accessing another RDS DB instance. Option C is not optimal because it will store the
credentials in AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store as a secure string parameter, which may
require additional steps or permissions to retrieve and decrypt the credentials from Parameter Store.
Option D is not optimal because it will use Lambda environment variables with a shared AWS Key
Management Service (AWS KMS) key for encryption, which may not be secure or scalable as
environment variables are stored as plain text unless encrypted with AWS KMS.

QUESTION 111
A developer is troubleshooting an Amazon API Gateway API Clients are receiving HTTP 400 response
errors when the clients try to access an endpoint of the API.
How can the developer determine the cause of these errors?
A. Create an Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream to receive API call logs from API Gateway.
Configure Amazon CloudWatch Logs as the delivery stream's destination.
B. Turn on AWS CloudTrail Insights and create a trail Specify the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the
trail for the stage of the API.
C. Turn on AWS X-Ray for the API stage Create an Amazon CtoudWalch Logs log group Specify the
Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the log group for the API stage.
D. Turn on execution logging and access logging in Amazon CloudWatch Logs for the API stage. Create
a CloudWatch Logs log group. Specify the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the log group for the API
stage.
Answer: D
Explanation:
This solution will meet the requirements by using Amazon CloudWatch Logs to capture and analyze
the logs from API Gateway. Amazon CloudWatch Logs is a service that monitors, stores, and accesses
log files from AWS resources. The developer can turn on execution logging and access logging in
Amazon CloudWatch Logs for the API stage, which enables logging information about API execution
and client access to the API. The developer can create a CloudWatch Logs log group, which is a
collection of log streams that share the same retention, monitoring, and access control settings. The
developer can specify the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the log group for the API stage, which
instructs API Gateway to send the logs to the specified log group. The developer can then examine
the logs to determine the cause of the HTTP 400 response errors. Option A is not optimal because it
will create an Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream to receive API call logs from API
Gateway, which may introduce additional costs and complexity for delivering and processing
streaming data. Option B is not optimal because it will turn on AWS CloudTrail Insights and create a
trail, which is a feature that helps identify and troubleshoot unusual API activity or operational
issues, not HTTP response errors. Option C is not optimal because it will turn on AWS X-Ray for the
API stage, which is a service that helps analyze and debug distributed applications, not HTTP
response errors.

QUESTION 112
A company developed an API application on AWS by using Amazon CloudFront. Amazon API
Gateway, and AWS Lambd

a. The API has a minimum of four requests every second A developer notices that many API users run
the same query by using the POST method. The developer wants to cache the POST request to
optimize the API resources.
Which solution will meet these requirements'?
A. Configure the CloudFront cache Update the application to return cached content based upon the
default request headers.
B. Override the cache method in me selected stage of API Gateway Select the POST method.
C. Save the latest request response in Lambda /tmp directory Update the Lambda function to check
the /tmp directory
D. Save the latest request m AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store Modify the Lambda function to
take the latest request response from Parameter Store
Answer: A
Explanation:
This solution will meet the requirements by using Amazon CloudFront, which is a content delivery
network (CDN) service that speeds up the delivery of web content and APIs to end users. The
developer can configure the CloudFront cache, which is a set of edge locations that store copies of
popular or recently accessed content close to the viewers. The developer can also update the
application to return cached content based upon the default request headers, which are a set of
HTTP headers that CloudFront automatically forwards to the origin server and uses to determine
whether an object in an edge location is still valid. By caching the POST requests, the developer can
optimize the API resources and reduce the latency for repeated queries. Option B is not optimal
because it will override the cache method in the selected stage of API Gateway, which is not possible
or effective as API Gateway does not support caching for POST methods by default. Option C is not
optimal because it will save the latest request response in Lambda /tmp directory, which is a local
storage space that is available for each Lambda function invocation, not a cache that can be shared
across multiple invocations or requests. Option D is not optimal because it will save the latest
request in AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store, which is a service that provides secure and
scalable storage for configuration data and secrets, not a cache for API responses.
Reference: [Amazon CloudFront], [Caching Content Based on Request Headers]
QUESTION 113
A company is building a micro services app1 cation that consists of many AWS Lambda functions. The
development team wants to use AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) templates to
automatically test the Lambda functions. The development team plans to test a small percentage of
traffic that is directed to new updates before the team commits to a full deployment of the
application.
Which combination of steps will meet these requirements in the MOST operationally efficient way?
(Select TWO.)

A. Use AWS SAM CLI commands in AWS CodeDeploy lo invoke the Lambda functions lo lest the
deployment
B. Declare the EventlnvokeConfig on the Lambda functions in the AWS SAM templates with
OnSuccess and OnFailure configurations.
C. Enable gradual deployments through AWS SAM templates.
D. Set the deployment preference type to Canary10Percen130Minutes Use hooks to test the
deployment.
E. Set the deployment preference type to Linear10PefcentEvery10Minutes Use hooks to test the
deployment.
Answer: C, D
Explanation:
This solution will meet the requirements by using AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM)
templates and gradual deployments to automatically test the Lambda functions. AWS SAM
templates are configuration files that define serverless applications and resources such as Lambda
functions. Gradual deployments are a feature of AWS SAM that enable deploying new versions of
Lambda functions incrementally, shifting traffic gradually, and performing validation tests during
deployment. The developer can enable gradual deployments through AWS SAM templates by adding
a DeploymentPreference property to each Lambda function resource in the template. The developer
can set the deployment preference type to Canary10Percent30Minutes, which means that 10
percent of traffic will be shifted to the new version of the Lambda function for 30 minutes before
shifting 100 percent of traffic. The developer can also use hooks to test the deployment, which are
custom Lambda functions that run before or after traffic shifting and perform validation tests or
rollback actions.
Reference: [AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM)], [Gradual Code Deployment]
QUESTION 114
A company is using AWS CioudFormation to deploy a two-tier application. The application will use
Amazon RDS as its backend database. The company wants a solution that will randomly generate the
database password during deployment. The solution also must automatically rotate the database
password without requiring changes to the application.
What is the MOST operationally efficient solution that meets these requirements'?
A. Use an AWS Lambda function as a CloudFormation custom resource to generate and rotate the
password.
B. Use an AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store resource with the SecureString data type to
generate and rotate the password.
C. Use a cron daemon on the application s host to generate and rotate the password.
D. Use an AWS Secrets Manager resource to generate and rotate the password.
Answer: D

Explanation:
This solution will meet the requirements by using AWS Secrets Manager, which is a service that
helps protect secrets such as database credentials by encrypting them with AWS Key Management
Service (AWS KMS) and enabling automatic rotation of secrets. The developer can use an AWS
Secrets Manager resource in AWS CloudFormation template, which enables creating and managing
secrets as part of a CloudFormation stack. The developer can use an AWS::SecretsManager::Secret
resource type to generate and rotate the password for accessing RDS database during deployment.
The developer can also specify a RotationSchedule property for the secret resource, which defines
how often to rotate the secret and which Lambda function to use for rotation logic. Option A is not
optimal because it will use an AWS Lambda function as a CloudFormation custom resource, which
may introduce additional complexity and overhead for creating and managing a custom resource and
implementing rotation logic. Option B is not optimal because it will use an AWS Systems Manager
Parameter Store resource with the SecureString data type, which does not support automatic
rotation of secrets. Option C is not optimal because it will use a cron daemon on the applications
host to generate and rotate the password, which may incur more costs and require more
maintenance for running and securing a host.
Reference: [AWS Secrets Manager], [AWS::SecretsManager::Secret]
QUESTION 115
A developer has been asked to create an AWS Lambda function that is invoked any time updates are
made to items in an Amazon DynamoDB table. The function has been created and appropriate
permissions have been added to the Lambda execution role Amazon DynamoDB streams have been
enabled for the table, but the function 15 still not being invoked.
Which option would enable DynamoDB table updates to invoke the Lambda function?
A. Change the StreamViewType parameter value to NEW_AND_OLOJMAGES for the DynamoDB
table.
B. Configure event source mapping for the Lambda function.
C. Map an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic to the DynamoDB streams.
D. Increase the maximum runtime (timeout) setting of the Lambda function.
Answer: B
Explanation:
This solution allows the Lambda function to be invoked by the DynamoDB stream whenever updates
are made to items in the DynamoDB table. Event source mapping is a feature of Lambda that enables
a function to be triggered by an event source, such as a DynamoDB stream, an Amazon Kinesis
stream, or an Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) queue. The developer can configure event source
mapping for the Lambda function using the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, or the AWS
SDKs. Changing the StreamViewType parameter value to NEW_AND_OLD_IMAGES for the
DynamoDB table will not affect the invocation of the Lambda function, but only change the

information that is written to the stream record. Mapping an Amazon Simple Notification Service
(Amazon SNS) topic to the DynamoDB stream will not invoke the Lambda function directly, but
require an additional subscription from the Lambda function to the SNS topic. Increasing the
maximum runtime (timeout) setting of the Lambda function will not affect the invocation of the
Lambda function, but only change how long the function can run before it is terminated.

QUESTION 116
A developer needs to deploy an application running on AWS Fargate using Amazon ECS The
application has environment variables that must be passed to a container for the application to
initialize.
How should the environment variables be passed to the container?
A. Define an array that includes the environment variables under the environment parameter within
the service definition.
B. Define an array that includes the environment variables under the environment parameter within
the task definition.
C. Define an array that includes the environment variables under the entryPoint parameter within
the task definition.
D. Define an array that includes the environment variables under the entryPoint parameter within
the service definition.
Answer: B
Explanation:
This solution allows the environment variables to be passed to the container when it is launched by
AWS Fargate using Amazon ECS. The task definition is a text file that describes one or more
containers that form an application. It contains various parameters for configuring the containers,
such as CPU and memory requirements, network mode, and environment variables. The
environment parameter is an array of key-value pairs that specify environment variables to pass to a
container. Defining an array that includes the environment variables under the entryPoint parameter
within the task definition will not pass them to the container, but use them as command-line
arguments for overriding the default entry point of a container. Defining an array that includes the
environment variables under the environment or entryPoint parameter within the service definition
will not pass them to the container, but cause an error because these parameters are not valid for a
service definition.
Reference: [Task Definition Parameters], [Environment Variables]
QUESTION 117
A developer is storing sensitive data generated by an application in Amazon S3. The developer wants
to encrypt the data at rest. A company policy requires an audit trail of when the AWS Key
Management Service (AWS KMS) key was used and by whom.

Which encryption option will meet these requirements?
A. Server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3)
B. Server-side encryption with AWS KMS managed keys (SSE-KMS}
C. Server-side encryption with customer-provided keys (SSE-C)
D. Server-side encryption with self-managed keys
Answer: B
Explanation:
This solution meets the requirements because it encrypts data at rest using AWS KMS keys and
provides an audit trail of when and by whom they were used. Server-side encryption with AWS KMS
managed keys (SSE-KMS) is a feature of Amazon S3 that encrypts data using keys that are managed
by AWS KMS. When SSE-KMS is enabled for an S3 bucket or object, S3 requests AWS KMS to generate
data keys and encrypts data using these keys. AWS KMS logs every use of its keys in AWS CloudTrail,
which records all API calls to AWS KMS as events. These events include information such as who
made the request, when it was made, and which key was used. The company policy can use
CloudTrail logs to audit critical events related to their data encryption and access. Server-side
encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3) also encrypts data at rest using keys that are
managed by S3, but does not provide an audit trail of key usage. Server-side encryption with
customer-provided keys (SSE-C) and server-side encryption with self-managed keys also encrypt data
at rest using keys that are provided or managed by customers, but do not provide an audit trail of key
usage and require additional overhead for key management.

QUESTION 118
A company has an ecommerce application. To track product reviews, the company's development
team uses an Amazon DynamoDB table.
Every record includes the following
A Review ID a 16-digrt universally unique identifier (UUID)
A Product ID and User ID 16 digit UUlDs that reference other tables
A Product Rating on a scale of 1-5
An optional comment from the user
The table partition key is the Review ID. The most performed query against the table is to find the 10
reviews with the highest rating for a given product.
Which index will provide the FASTEST response for this query"?
A. A global secondary index (GSl) with Product ID as the partition key and Product Rating as the sort
key
B. A global secondary index (GSl) with Product ID as the partition key and Review ID as the sort key
C. A local secondary index (LSI) with Product ID as the partition key and Product Rating as the sort

key
D. A local secondary index (LSI) with Review ID as the partition key and Product ID as the sort key
Answer: A
Explanation:
This solution allows the fastest response for the query because it enables the query to use a single
partition key value (the Product ID) and a range of sort key values (the Product Rating) to find the
matching items. A global secondary index (GSI) is an index that has a partition key and an optional
sort key that are different from those on the base table. A GSI can be created at any time and can be
queried or scanned independently of the base table. A local secondary index (LSI) is an index that has
the same partition key as the base table, but a different sort key. An LSI can only be created when the
base table is created and must be queried together with the base table partition key. Using a GSI
with Product ID as the partition key and Review ID as the sort key will not allow the query to use a
range of sort key values to find the highest ratings. Using an LSI with Product ID as the partition key
and Product Rating as the sort key will not work because Product ID is not the partition key of the
base table. Using an LSI with Review ID as the partition key and Product ID as the sort key will not
allow the query to use a single partition key value to find the matching items.

QUESTION 119
A company needs to distribute firmware updates to its customers around the world.
Which service will allow easy and secure control of the access to the downloads at the lowest cost?
A. Use Amazon CloudFront with signed URLs for Amazon S3.
B. Create a dedicated Amazon CloudFront Distribution for each customer.
C. Use Amazon CloudFront with AWS Lambda@Edge.
D. Use Amazon API Gateway and AWS Lambda to control access to an S3 bucket.
Answer: A
Explanation:
This solution allows easy and secure control of access to the downloads at the lowest cost because it
uses a content delivery network (CDN) that can cache and distribute firmware updates to customers
around the world, and uses a mechanism that can restrict access to specific files or versions. Amazon
CloudFront is a CDN that can improve performance, availability, and security of web applications by
delivering content from edge locations closer to customers. Amazon S3 is a storage service that can
store firmware updates in buckets and objects. Signed URLs are URLs that include additional
information, such as an expiration date and time, that give users temporary access to specific objects
in S3 buckets. The developer can use CloudFront to serve firmware updates from S3 buckets and use
signed URLs to control who can download them and for how long. Creating a dedicated CloudFront
distribution for each customer will incur unnecessary costs and complexity. Using Amazon

CloudFront with AWS Lambda@Edge will require additional programming overhead to implement
custom logic at the edge locations. Using Amazon API Gateway and AWS Lambda to control access to
an S3 bucket will also require additional programming overhead and may not provide optimal
performance or availability.

QUESTION 120
A developer is testing an application that invokes an AWS Lambda function asynchronously. During
the testing phase the Lambda function fails to process after two retries.
How can the developer troubleshoot the failure?
A. Configure AWS CloudTrail logging to investigate the invocation failures.
B. Configure Dead Letter Queues by sending events to Amazon SQS for investigation.
C. Configure Amazon Simple Workflow Service to process any direct unprocessed events.
D. Configure AWS Config to process any direct unprocessed events.
Answer: B
Explanation:
This solution allows the developer to troubleshoot the failure by capturing unprocessed events in a
queue for further analysis. Dead Letter Queues (DLQs) are queues that store messages that could not
be processed by a service, such as Lambda, for various reasons, such as configuration errors,
throttling limits, or permissions issues. The developer can configure DLQs for Lambda functions by
sending events to either an Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) queue or an Amazon Simple
Notification Service (SNS) topic. The developer can then inspect the messages in the queue or topic
to identify and fix the root cause of the failure. Configuring AWS CloudTrail logging will not capture
invocation failures for asynchronous Lambda invocations, but only record API calls made by or on
behalf of Lambda. Configuring Amazon Simple Workflow Service (SWF) or AWS Config will not
process any direct unprocessed events, but require additional integration and configuration.
Reference: [Using AWS Lambda with DLQs], [Asynchronous invocation]
QUESTION 121
A company is migrating its PostgreSQL database into the AWS Cloud. The company wants to use a
database that will secure and regularly rotate database credentials. The company wants a solution
that does not require additional programming overhead.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A. Use Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL tor the database. Store the database credentials in AWS Systems
Manager Parameter Store Turn on rotation.
B. Use Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL for the database. Store the database credentials in AWS Secrets
Manager Turn on rotation.
C. Use Amazon DynamoDB for the database. Store the database credentials in AWS Systems Manager

Parameter Store Turn on rotation.
D. Use Amazon DynamoDB for the database. Store the database credentials in AWS Secrets Manager
Turn on rotation.
Answer: B
Explanation:
This solution meets the requirements because it uses a PostgreSQL-compatible database that can
secure and regularly rotate database credentials without requiring additional programming
overhead. Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL is a relational database service that is compatible with
PostgreSQL and offers high performance, availability, and scalability. AWS Secrets Manager is a
service that helps you protect secrets needed to access your applications, services, and IT resources.
You can store database credentials in AWS Secrets Manager and use them to access your Aurora
PostgreSQL database. You can also enable automatic rotation of your secrets according to a schedule
or an event. AWS Secrets Manager handles the complexity of rotating secrets for you, such as
generating new passwords and updating your database with the new credentials. Using Amazon
DynamoDB for the database will not meet the requirements because it is a NoSQL database that is
not compatible with PostgreSQL. Using AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store for storing and
rotating database credentials will require additional programming overhead to integrate with your
database.

QUESTION 122
A developer is creating a mobile application that will not require users to log in.
What is the MOST efficient method to grant users access to AWS resources'?
A. Use an identity provider to securely authenticate with the application.
B. Create an AWS Lambda function to create an 1AM user when a user accesses the application.
C. Create credentials using AWS KMS and apply these credentials to users when using the
application.
D. Use Amazon Cognito to associate unauthenticated users with an IAM role that has limited access
to resources.
Answer: D
Explanation:
This solution is the most efficient method to grant users access to AWS resources without requiring
them to log in. Amazon Cognito is a service that provides user sign-up, sign-in, and access control for
web and mobile applications. Amazon Cognito identity pools support both authenticated and
unauthenticated users. Unauthenticated users receive access to your AWS resources even if they
arent logged in with any of your identity providers (IdPs). You can use Amazon Cognito to associate
unauthenticated users with an IAM role that has limited access to resources, such as Amazon S3

buckets or DynamoDB tables. This degree of access is useful to display content to users before they
log in or to allow them to perform certain actions without signing up. Using an identity provider to
securely authenticate with the application will require users to log in, which does not meet the
requirement. Creating an AWS Lambda function to create an IAM user when a user accesses the
application will incur unnecessary costs and complexity, and may pose security risks if not
implemented properly. Creating credentials using AWS KMS and applying them to users when using
the application will also incur unnecessary costs and complexity, and may not provide fine-grained
access control for resources.

access to your API without authentication (Anonymous user access)
QUESTION 123
A company has developed a new serverless application using AWS Lambda functions that will be
deployed using the AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) CLI.
Which step should the developer complete prior to deploying the application?
A. Compress the application to a zip file and upload it into AWS Lambda.
B. Test the new AWS Lambda function by first tracing it m AWS X-Ray.
C. Bundle the serverless application using a SAM package.
D. Create the application environment using the eb create my-env command.
Answer: C
Explanation:
This step should be completed prior to deploying the application because it prepares the application
artifacts for deployment. The AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) is a framework that
simplifies building and deploying serverless applications on AWS. The AWS SAM CLI is a commandline
tool that helps you create, test, and deploy serverless applications using AWS SAM templates.
The sam package command bundles the application artifacts, such as Lambda function code and API
definitions, and uploads them to an Amazon S3 bucket. The command also returns a CloudFormation
template that is ready to be deployed with the sam deploy command. Compressing the application
to a zip file and uploading it to AWS Lambda will not work because it does not use AWS SAM
templates or CloudFormation. Testing the new Lambda function by first tracing it in AWS X-Ray will
not prepare the application for deployment, but only monitor its performance and errors. Creating
the application environment using the eb create my-env command will not work because it is a
command for AWS Elastic Beanstalk, not AWS SAM.
QUESTION 124
A company wants to automate part of its deployment process. A developer needs to automate the
process of checking for and deleting unused resources that supported previously deployed stacks but
that are no longer used.
The company has a central application that uses the AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) to

manage all deployment stacks. The stacks are spread out across multiple accounts. The developers
solution must integrate as seamlessly as possible within the current deployment process.
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST amount of configuration?
A. In the central AWS CDK application, write a handler function in the code that uses AWS SDK calls
to check for and delete unused resources. Create an AWS CloudPormation template from a JSON file.
Use the template to attach the function code to an AWS Lambda function and lo invoke the Lambda
function when the deployment slack runs.
B. In the central AWS CDK application. write a handler function in the code that uses AWS SDK calls
to check for and delete unused resources. Create an AWS CDK custom resource Use the custom
resource to attach the function code to an AWS Lambda function and to invoke the Lambda function
when the deployment stack runs.
C. In the central AWS CDK, write a handler function m the code that uses AWS SDK calls to check for
and delete unused resources. Create an API in AWS Amplify Use the API to attach the function code
to an AWS Lambda function and to invoke the Lambda function when the deployment stack runs.
D. In the AWS Lambda console write a handler function in the code that uses AWS SDK calls to check
for and delete unused resources. Create an AWS CDK custom resource. Use the custom resource to
import the Lambda function into the stack and to Invoke the Lambda function when the deployment
stack runs.
Answer: B
Explanation:
This solution meets the requirements with the least amount of configuration because it uses a
feature of AWS CDK that allows custom logic to be executed during stack deployment or deletion.
The AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) is a software development framework that allows you to
define cloud infrastructure as code and provision it through CloudFormation. An AWS CDK custom
resource is a construct that enables you to create resources that are not natively supported by
CloudFormation or perform tasks that are not supported by CloudFormation during stack
deployment or deletion. The developer can write a handler function in the code that uses AWS SDK
calls to check for and delete unused resources, and create an AWS CDK custom resource that
attaches the function code to a Lambda function and invokes it when the deployment stack runs. This
way, the developer can automate the cleanup process without requiring additional configuration or
integration. Creating a CloudFormation template from a JSON file will require additional
configuration and integration with the central AWS CDK application. Creating an API in AWS Amplify
will require additional configuration and integration with the central AWS CDK application and may
not provide optimal performance or availability. Writing a handler function in the AWS Lambda
console will require additional configuration and integration with the central AWS CDK application.

QUESTION 125
A company built a new application in the AWS Cloud. The company automated the bootstrapping of

new resources with an Auto Scaling group by using AWS Cloudf-ormation templates. The bootstrap
scripts contain sensitive data.
The company needs a solution that is integrated with CloudFormation to manage the sensitive data
in the bootstrap scripts.
Which solution will meet these requirements in the MOST secure way?
A. Put the sensitive data into a CloudFormation parameter. Encrypt the CloudFormation templates by
using an AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) key.
B. Put the sensitive data into an Amazon S3 bucket Update the CloudFormation templates to
download the object from Amazon S3 during bootslrap.
C. Put the sensitive data into AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store as a secure string parameter.
Update the CloudFormation templates to use dynamic references to specify template values.
D. Put the sensitive data into Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EPS) Enforce EFS encryption after
file system creation. Update the CloudFormation templates to retrieve data from Amazon EFS.
Answer: C
Explanation:
This solution meets the requirements in the most secure way because it uses a service that is
integrated with CloudFormation to manage sensitive data in encrypted form. AWS Systems Manager
Parameter Store provides secure, hierarchical storage for configuration data management and
secrets management. You can store sensitive data as secure string parameters, which are encrypted
using an AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) key of your choice. You can also use dynamic
references in your CloudFormation templates to specify template values that are stored in Parameter
Store or Secrets Manager without having to include them in your templates. Dynamic references are
resolved only during stack creation or update operations, which reduces exposure risks for sensitive
data. Putting sensitive data into a CloudFormation parameter will not encrypt them or protect them
from unauthorized access. Putting sensitive data into an Amazon S3 bucket or Amazon Elastic File
System (Amazon EFS) will require additional configuration and integration with CloudFormation and
may not provide fine-grained access control or encryption for sensitive data.

Template Values]
QUESTION 126
A company needs to set up secure database credentials for all its AWS Cloud resources. The
company's resources include Amazon RDS DB instances Amazon DocumentDB clusters and Amazon
Aurora DB instances. The company's security policy mandates that database credentials be encrypted
at rest and rotated at a regular interval.
Which solution will meet these requirements MOST securely?
A. Set up IAM database authentication for token-based access. Generate user tokens to provide
centralized access to RDS DB instances. Amazon DocumentDB clusters and Aurora DB instances.

B. Create parameters for the database credentials in AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store Set the
Type parameter to Secure Sting. Set up automatic rotation on the parameters.
C. Store the database access credentials as an encrypted Amazon S3 object in an S3 bucket Block all
public access on the S3 bucket. Use S3 server-side encryption to set up automatic rotation on the
encryption key.
D. Create an AWS Lambda function by using the SecretsManagerRotationTemplate template in the
AWS Secrets Manager console. Create secrets for the database credentials in Secrets Manager Set up
secrets rotation on a schedule.
Answer: D
Explanation:
This solution will meet the requirements by using AWS Secrets Manager, which is a service that
helps protect secrets such as database credentials by encrypting them with AWS Key Management
Service (AWS KMS) and enabling automatic rotation of secrets. The developer can create an AWS
Lambda function by using the SecretsManagerRotationTemplate template in the AWS Secrets
Manager console, which provides a sample code for rotating secrets for RDS DB instances, Amazon
DocumentDB clusters, and Amazon Aurora DB instances. The developer can also create secrets for
the database credentials in Secrets Manager, which encrypts them at rest and provides secure access
to them. The developer can set up secrets rotation on a schedule, which changes the database
credentials periodically according to a specified interval or event. Option A is not optimal because it
will set up IAM database authentication for token-based access, which may not be compatible with
all database engines and may require additional configuration and management of IAM roles or
users. Option B is not optimal because it will create parameters for the database credentials in AWS
Systems Manager Parameter Store, which does not support automatic rotation of secrets. Option C is
not optimal because it will store the database access credentials as an encrypted Amazon S3 object
in an S3 bucket, which may introduce additional costs and complexity for accessing and securing the
data.

QUESTION 127
A developer has created an AWS Lambda function that makes queries to an Amazon Aurora MySQL
DB instance. When the developer performs a test the OB instance shows an error for too many
connections.
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational effort?
A. Create a read replica for the DB instance Query the replica DB instance instead of the primary DB
instance.
B. Migrate the data lo an Amazon DynamoDB database.
C. Configure the Amazon Aurora MySQL DB instance tor Multi-AZ deployment.
D. Create a proxy in Amazon RDS Proxy Query the proxy instead of the DB instance.

Answer: D
Explanation:
This solution will meet the requirements by using Amazon RDS Proxy, which is a fully managed,
highly available database proxy for Amazon RDS that makes applications more scalable, more
resilient to database failures, and more secure. The developer can create a proxy in Amazon RDS
Proxy, which sits between the application and the DB instance and handles connection management,
pooling, and routing. The developer can query the proxy instead of the DB instance, which reduces
the number of open connections to the DB instance and avoids errors for too many connections.
Option A is not optimal because it will create a read replica for the DB instance, which may not solve
the problem of too many connections as read replicas also have connection limits and may incur
additional costs. Option B is not optimal because it will migrate the data to an Amazon DynamoDB
database, which may introduce additional complexity and overhead for migrating and accessing data
from a different database service. Option C is not optimal because it will configure the Amazon
Aurora MySQL DB instance for Multi-AZ deployment, which may improve availability and durability of
the DB instance but not reduce the number of connections.

QUESTION 128
A company uses Amazon API Gateway to expose a set of APIs to customers. The APIs have caching
enabled in API Gateway. Customers need a way to invalidate the cache for each API when they test
the API.
What should a developer do to give customers the ability to invalidate the API cache?
A. Ask the customers to use AWS credentials to call the InvalidateCache API operation.
B. Attach an InvalidateCache policy to the IAM execution role that the customers use to invoke the
API. Ask the customers to send a request that contains the
HTTP header when they make an API call.
C. Ask the customers to use the AWS SDK API Gateway class to invoke the InvalidateCache API
operation.
D. Attach an InvalidateCache policy to the IAM execution role that the customers use to invoke the
API. Ask the customers to add the INVALIDATE_CACHE query
string parameter when they make an API call.

QUESTION 129
A developer is building a serverless application by using AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS
SAM) on multiple AWS Lambda functions. When the application is deployed, the developer wants to
shift 10% of the traffic to the new deployment of the application for the first 10 minutes after

deployment. If there are no issues, all traffic must switch over to the new version.
Which change to the AWS SAM template will meet these requirements?
A. Set the Deployment Preference Type to Canaryl OPercent10Minutes. Set the AutoPublishAlias
property to the Lambda alias.
B. Set the Deployment Preference Type to Linearl OPercentEveryIOMinutes. Set AutoPubIishAIias
property to the Lambda alias.
C. Set the Deployment Preference Type to Canaryl OPercentIOMinutes. Set the PreTraffic and
PostTraffic properties to the Lambda alias.
D. Set the Deployment Preference Type to Linearl OPercentEvery10Minutes. Set PreTraffic and
PostTraffic properties to the Lambda alias.
Answer: A
Explanation:
The Deployment Preference Type property specifies how traffic should be shifted between versions
of a Lambda function1. The Canary10Percent10Minutes option means that 10% of the traffic is
immediately shifted to the new version, and after 10 minutes, the remaining 90% of the traffic is
shifted1. This matches the requirement of shifting 10% of the traffic for the first 10 minutes, and then
switching all traffic to the new version.
The AutoPublishAlias property enables AWS SAM to automatically create and update a Lambda alias
that points to the latest version of the function1. This is required to use the Deployment Preference
Type property1. The alias name can be specified by the developer, and it can be used to invoke the
function with the latest code.
QUESTION 130
A developer is preparing to begin development of a new version of an application. The previous
version of the application is deployed in a production environment. The developer needs to deploy
fixes and updates to the current version during the development of the new version of the
application. The code for the new version of the application is stored in AWS CodeCommit.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A. From the main branch, create a feature branch for production bug fixes. Create a second feature
branch from the main branch for development of the new version.
B. Create a Git tag of the code that is currently deployed in production. Create a Git tag for the
development of the new version. Push the two tags to the
CodeCommit repository.
C. From the main branch, create a branch of the code that is currently deployed in production. Apply
an IAM policy that ensures no other other users can push or merge to the branch.
D. Create a new CodeCommit repository for development of the new version of the application.
Create a Git tag for the development of the new version.

Answer: A
Explanation:
A feature branch is a branch that is created from the main branch to work on a specific feature or
task1. Feature branches allow developers to isolate their work from the main branch and avoid
conflicts with other changes1. Feature branches can be merged back to the main branch when the
feature or task is completed and tested1.
In this scenario, the developer needs to maintain two parallel streams of work: one for fixing and
updating the current version of the application that is deployed in production, and another for
developing the new version of the application. The developer can use feature branches to achieve
this goal.
The developer can create a feature branch from the main branch for production bug fixes. This
branch will contain the code that is currently deployed in production, and any fixes or updates that
need to be applied to it. The developer can push this branch to the CodeCommit repository and use
it to deploy changes to the production environment.
The developer can also create a second feature branch from the main branch for development of the
new version of the application. This branch will contain the code that is under development for the
new version, and any changes or enhancements that are part of it. The developer can push this
branch to the CodeCommit repository and use it to test and deploy the new version of the
application in a separate environment.
By using feature branches, the developer can keep the main branch stable and clean, and avoid
mixing code from different versions of the application. The developer can also easily switch between
branches and merge them when needed.
QUESTION 131
A developer is creating a new REST API by using Amazon API Gateway and AWS Lambd
a. The development team tests the API and validates responses for the known use cases before
deploying the API to the production environment.
The developer wants to make the REST API available for testing by using API Gateway locally.
Which AWS Serverless Application Model Command Line Interface (AWS SAM CLI) subcommand will
meet these requirements?
A. Sam local invoke
B. Sam local generate-event
C. Sam local start-lambda
D. Sam local start-api
Answer: D
Explanation:
The sam local start-api subcommand allows you to run your serverless application locally for quick
development and testing1. It creates a local HTTP server that acts as a proxy for API Gateway and

invokes your Lambda functions based on the AWS SAM template1. You can use the sam local startapi
subcommand to test your REST API locally by sending HTTP requests to the local endpoint1.
QUESTION 132
A developer is writing an application that will retrieve sensitive data from a third-party system. The
application will format the data into a PDF file. The PDF file could be more than 1 MB. The
application will encrypt the data to disk by using AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS). The
application will decrypt the file when a user requests to download it. The retrieval and formatting
portions of the application are complete.
The developer needs to use the GenerateDataKey API to encrypt the PDF file so that the PDF file can
be decrypted later. The developer needs to use an AWS KMS symmetric customer managed key for
encryption.
Which solutions will meet these requirements?
A. Write the encrypted key from the GenerateDataKey API to disk for later use. Use the plaintext key
from the GenerateDataKey API and a symmetric encryption
algorithm to encrypt the file.
B. Write the plain text key from the GenerateDataKey API to disk for later use. Use the encrypted key
from the GenerateDataKey API and a symmetric encryption
algorithm to encrypt the file.
C. Write the encrypted key from the GenerateDataKey API to disk for later use. Use the plaintext key
from the GenerateDataKey API to encrypt the file by using the KMS Encrypt API
D. Write the plain text key from the GenerateDataKey API to disk for later use. Use the encrypted key
from the GenerateDataKey API to encrypt the file by using the KMS Encrypt API
Answer: A
Explanation:
The GenerateDataKey API returns a data key that is encrypted under a symmetric encryption KMS
key that you specify, and a plaintext copy of the same data key1. The data key is a random byte string
that can be used with any standard encryption algorithm, such as AES or SM42. The plaintext data
key can be used to encrypt or decrypt data outside of AWS KMS, while the encrypted data key can be
stored with the encrypted data and later decrypted by AWS KMS1.
In this scenario, the developer needs to use the GenerateDataKey API to encrypt the PDF file so that
it can be decrypted later. The developer also needs to use an AWS KMS symmetric customer
managed key for encryption. To achieve this, the developer can follow these steps:
Call the GenerateDataKey API with the symmetric customer managed key ID and the desired length
or specification of the data key. The API will return an encrypted data key and a plaintext data key.
Write the encrypted data key to disk for later use. This will allow the developer to decrypt the data
key and the PDF file later by using AWS KMS.
Use the plaintext data key and a symmetric encryption algorithm to encrypt the PDF file. The
developer can use any standard encryption library or tool to perform this operation, such as OpenSSL

or AWS Encryption SDK.
Discard the plaintext data key from memory as soon as possible after using it. This will prevent
unauthorized access or leakage of the data key.
QUESTION 133
A developer is optimizing an AWS Lambda function and wants to test the changes in production on a
small percentage of all traffic. The Lambda function serves requests to a REST API in Amazon API
Gateway. The developer needs to deploy their changes and perform a test in production without
changing the API Gateway URL.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A. Define a function version for the currently deployed production Lambda function. Update the API
Gateway endpoint to reference the new Lambda function version. Upload and publish the optimized
Lambda function code. On the production API Gateway stage, define a canary release and set the
percentage of traffic to direct to the canary release. Update the API Gateway endpoint to use the
$LATEST version of the Lambda function. Publish the API to the canary stage.
B. Define a function version for the currently deployed production Lambda function. Update the API
Gateway endpoint to reference the new Lambda function version. Upload and publish the optimized
Lambda function code. Update the API Gateway endpoint to use the $LATEST version of the Lambda
function.
Deploy a new API Gateway stage.
C. Define an alias on the $LATEST version of the Lambda function. Update the API Gateway endpoint
to reference the new Lambda function alias. Upload and
publish the optimized Lambda function code. On the production API Gateway stage, define a canary
release and set the percentage of traffic to direct to the canary release. Update the API Gateway
endpoint to use the SLAT EST version of the Lambda function. Publish to the canary stage.
D. Define a function version for the currently deployed production Lambda function. Update the API
Gateway endpoint to reference the new Lambda function
version. Upload and publish the optimized Lambda function code. Update the API Gateway endpoint
to use the $LATEST version of the Lambda function.
Deploy the API to the production API Gateway stage.
Answer: C
Explanation:
A Lambda alias is a pointer to a specific Lambda function version or another alias1. A Lambda alias
allows you to invoke different versions of a function using the same name1. You can also split traffic
between two aliases by assigning weights to them1.
In this scenario, the developer needs to test their changes in production on a small percentage of all
traffic without changing the API Gateway URL. To achieve this, the developer can follow these steps:
Define an alias on the $LATEST version of the Lambda function. This will create a new alias that
points to the latest code of the function.

Update the API Gateway endpoint to reference the new Lambda function alias. This will make the
API Gateway invoke the alias instead of a specific version of the function.
Upload and publish the optimized Lambda function code. This will update the $LATEST version of the
function with the new code.
On the production API Gateway stage, define a canary release and set the percentage of traffic to
direct to the canary release. This will enable API Gateway to perform a canary deployment on a new
API2. A canary deployment is a software development strategy in which a new version of an API is
deployed for testing purposes, and the base version remains deployed as a production release for
normal operations on the same stage2. The canary release receives a small percentage of API traffic
and the production release takes up the rest2.
Update the API Gateway endpoint to use the $LATEST version of the Lambda function. This will make
the canary release invoke the latest code of the function, which contains the optimized changes.
Publish to the canary stage. This will deploy the changes to a subset of users for testing.
By using this solution, the developer can test their changes in production on a small percentage of all
traffic without changing the API Gateway URL. The developer can also monitor and compare metrics
between the canary and production releases, and promote or disable the canary as needed2.
QUESTION 134
A company has an application that stores data in Amazon RDS instances. The application periodically
experiences surges of high traffic that cause performance problems.
During periods of peak traffic, a developer notices a reduction in query speed in all database queries.
The team's technical lead determines that a multi-threaded and scalable caching solution should be
used to offload the heavy read traffic. The solution needs to improve performance.
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST complexity?
A. Use Amazon ElastiCache for Memcached to offload read requests from the main database.
B. Replicate the data to Amazon DynamoDB. Set up a DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) cluster.
C. Configure the Amazon RDS instances to use Multi-AZ deployment with one standby instance.
Offload read requests from the main database to the standby
instance.
D. Use Amazon ElastiCache for Redis to offload read requests from the main database.
Answer: A
Explanation:
Amazon ElastiCache for Memcached is a fully managed, multithreaded, and scalable in-memory keyvalue
store that can be used to cache frequently accessed data and improve application
performance1. By using Amazon ElastiCache for Memcached, the developer can reduce the load on
the main database and handle high traffic surges more efficiently.
To use Amazon ElastiCache for Memcached, the developer needs to create a cache cluster with one
or more nodes, and configure the application to store and retrieve data from the cache cluster2. The
developer can use any of the supported Memcached clients to interact with the cache cluster3. The

developer can also use Auto Discovery to dynamically discover and connect to all cache nodes in a
cluster4.
Amazon ElastiCache for Memcached is compatible with the Memcached protocol, which means that
the developer can use existing tools and libraries that work with Memcached1. Amazon ElastiCache
for Memcached also supports data partitioning, which allows the developer to distribute data among
multiple nodes and scale out the cache cluster as needed.
Using Amazon ElastiCache for Memcached is a simple and effective solution that meets the
requirements with the least complexity. The developer does not need to change the database
schema, migrate data to a different service, or use a different caching model. The developer can
leverage the existing Memcached ecosystem and easily integrate it with the application.
QUESTION 135
An application that runs on AWS receives messages from an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon
SQS) queue and processes the messages in batches. The
application sends the data to another SQS queue to be consumed by another legacy application. The
legacy system can take up to 5 minutes to process some transaction dat
a.
A developer wants to ensure that there are no out-of-order updates in the legacy system. The
developer cannot alter the behavior of the legacy system.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A. Use an SQS FIFO queue. Configure the visibility timeout value.
B. Use an SQS standard queue with a SendMessageBatchRequestEntry data type. Configure the
DelaySeconds values.
C. Use an SQS standard queue with a SendMessageBatchRequestEntry data type. Configure the
visibility timeout value.
D. Use an SQS FIFO queue. Configure the DelaySeconds value.
Answer: A
Explanation:
An SQS FIFO queue is a type of queue that preserves the order of messages and ensures that each
message is delivered and processed only once1. This is suitable for the scenario where the developer
wants to ensure that there are no out-of-order updates in the legacy system.
The visibility timeout value is the amount of time that a message is invisible in the queue after a
consumer receives it2. This prevents other consumers from processing the same message
simultaneously. If the consumer does not delete the message before the visibility timeout expires,
the message becomes visible again and another consumer can receive it2.
In this scenario, the developer needs to configure the visibility timeout value to be longer than the
maximum processing time of the legacy system, which is 5 minutes. This will ensure that the
message remains invisible in the queue until the legacy system finishes processing it and deletes it.
This will prevent duplicate or out-of-order processing of messages by the legacy system.

QUESTION 136
A developer is troubleshooting an application in an integration environment. In the application, an
Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue consumes messages and then an AWS Lambda
function processes the messages. The Lambda function transforms the messages and makes an API
call to a third-party service.
There has been an increase in application usage. The third-party API frequently returns an HTTP 429
Too Many Requests error message. The error message prevents a significant number of messages
from being processed successfully.
How can the developer resolve this issue?
A. Increase the SQS event source's batch size setting.
B. Configure provisioned concurrency for the Lambda function based on the third-party API's
documented rate limits.
C. Increase the retry attempts and maximum event age in the Lambda function's asynchronous
configuration.
D. Configure maximum concurrency on the SQS event source based on the third-party service's
documented rate limits.
Answer: D
Explanation:
Maximum concurrency for SQS as an event source allows customers to control the maximum
concurrent invokes by the SQS event source1. When multiple SQS event sources are configured to a
function, customers can control the maximum concurrent invokes of individual SQS event source1.
In this scenario, the developer needs to resolve the issue of the third-party API frequently returning
an HTTP 429 Too Many Requests error message, which prevents a significant number of messages
from being processed successfully. To achieve this, the developer can follow these steps:
Find out the documented rate limits of the third-party API, which specify how many requests can be
made in a given time period.
Configure maximum concurrency on the SQS event source based on the rate limits of the third-party
API. This will limit the number of concurrent invokes by the SQS event source and prevent exceeding
the rate limits of the third-party API.
Test and monitor the application performance and adjust the maximum concurrency value as
needed.
By using this solution, the developer can reduce the frequency of HTTP 429 errors and improve the
message processing success rate. The developer can also avoid throttling or blocking by the third-
party API.
QUESTION 137
An online sales company is developing a serverless application that runs on AWS. The application
uses an AWS Lambda function that calculates order success rates and stores the data in an Amazon

DynamoDB table. A developer wants an efficient way to invoke the Lambda function every 15
minutes.
Which solution will meet this requirement with the LEAST development effort?
A. Create an Amazon EventBridge rule that has a rate expression that will run the rule every 15
minutes. Add the Lambda function as the target of the
EventBridge rule.
B. Create an AWS Systems Manager document that has a script that will invoke the Lambda function
on Amazon EC2. Use a Systems Manager Run Command
task to run the shell script every 15 minutes.
C. Create an AWS Step Functions state machine. Configure the state machine to invoke the Lambda
function execution role at a specified interval by using a Wait state. Set the interval to 15 minutes.
D. Provision a small Amazon EC2 instance. Set up a cron job that invokes the Lambda function every
15 minutes.
Answer: A
Explanation:
The best solution for this requirement is option
A) Creating an Amazon EventBridge rule that has a rate expression that will run the rule every 15
minutes and adding the Lambda function as the target of the EventBridge rule is the most efficient
way to invoke the Lambda function periodically. This solution does not require any additional
resources or development effort, and it leverages the built-in scheduling capabilities of
EventBridge1.
QUESTION 138
A developer is migrating an application to Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS). The
developer migrates the application to Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR) with an EKS
cluster.
As part of the application migration to a new backend, the developer creates a new AWS account.
The developer makes configuration changes to the application to point the application to the new
AWS account and to use new backend resources. The developer successfully tests the changes within
the application by deploying the pipeline.
The Docker image build and the pipeline deployment are successful, but the application is still
connecting to the old backend. The developer finds that the application's configuration is still
referencing the original EKS cluster and not referencing the new backend resources.
Which reason can explain why the application is not connecting to the new resources?
A. The developer did not successfully create the new AWS account.
B. The developer added a new tag to the Docker image.
C. The developer did not update the Docker image tag to a new version.
D. The developer pushed the changes to a new Docker image tag.

Answer: C
Explanation:
The correct answer is C) The developer did not update the Docker image tag to a new version.
C) The developer did not update the Docker image tag to a new version. This is correct. When
deploying an application to Amazon EKS, the developer needs to specify the Docker image tag that
contains the application code and configuration. If the developer does not update the Docker image
tag to a new version after making changes to the application, the EKS cluster will continue to use the
old Docker image tag that references the original backend resources. To fix this issue, the developer
should update the Docker image tag to a new version and redeploy the application to the EKS cluster.
A) The developer did not successfully create the new AWS account. This is incorrect. The creation of a
new AWS account is not related to the applications connection to the backend resources. The
developer can use any AWS account to host the EKS cluster and the backend resources, as long as
they have the proper permissions and configurations.
B) The developer added a new tag to the Docker image. This is incorrect. Adding a new tag to the
Docker image is not enough to deploy the changes to the application. The developer also needs to
update the Docker image tag in the EKS cluster configuration, so that the EKS cluster can pull and run
the new Docker image.
D) The developer pushed the changes to a new Docker image tag. This is incorrect. Pushing the
changes to a new Docker image tag is not enough to deploy the changes to the application. The
developer also needs to update the Docker image tag in the EKS cluster configuration, so that the EKS
cluster can pull and run the new Docker image.

QUESTION 139
A developer at a company needs to create a small application that makes the same API call once
each day at a designated time. The company does not have infrastructure in the AWS Cloud yet, but
the company wants to implement this functionality on AWS.
Which solution meets these requirements in the MOST operationally efficient manner?
A. Use a Kubernetes cron job that runs on Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS).
B. Use an Amazon Linux crontab scheduled job that runs on Amazon EC2.
C. Use an AWS Lambda function that is invoked by an Amazon EventBridge scheduled event.
D. Use an AWS Batch job that is submitted to an AWS Batch job queue.

Answer: C
Explanation:
The correct answer is C) Use an AWS Lambda function that is invoked by an Amazon EventBridge
scheduled event.
C) Use an AWS Lambda function that is invoked by an Amazon EventBridge scheduled event. This is
correct. AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or
managing servers. Lambda runs your code on a high-availability compute infrastructure and performs
all of the administration of the compute resources, including server and operating system
maintenance, capacity provisioning and automatic scaling, and logging1. Amazon EventBridge is a
serverless event bus service that enables you to connect your applications with data from a variety of
sources2. EventBridge can create rules that run on a schedule, either at regular intervals or at
specific times and dates, and invoke targets such as Lambda functions3. This solution meets the
requirements of creating a small application that makes the same API call once each day at a
designated time, without requiring any infrastructure in the AWS Cloud or any operational overhead.
A) Use a Kubernetes cron job that runs on Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS). This is
incorrect. Amazon EKS is a fully managed Kubernetes service that allows you to run containerized
applications on AWS4. Kubernetes cron jobs are tasks that run periodically on a given schedule5. This
solution could meet the functional requirements of creating a small application that makes the same
API call once each day at a designated time, but it would not be the most operationally efficient
manner. The company would need to provision and manage an EKS cluster, which would incur
additional costs and complexity.
B) Use an Amazon Linux crontab scheduled job that runs on Amazon EC2. This is incorrect. Amazon
EC2 is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud6. Crontab is a
Linux utility that allows you to schedule commands or scripts to run automatically at a specified time
or date7. This solution could meet the functional requirements of creating a small application that
makes the same API call once each day at a designated time, but it would not be the most
operationally efficient manner. The company would need to provision and manage an EC2 instance,
which would incur additional costs and complexity.
D) Use an AWS Batch job that is submitted to an AWS Batch job queue. This is incorrect. AWS Batch
enables you to run batch computing workloads on the AWS Cloud8. Batch jobs are units of work that
can be submitted to job queues, where they are executed in parallel or sequentially on compute
environments9. This solution could meet the functional requirements of creating a small application
that makes the same API call once each day at a designated time, but it would not be the most
operationally efficient manner. The company would need to configure and manage an AWS Batch
environment, which would incur additional costs and complexity.

QUESTION 140
An developer is building a serverless application by using the AWS Serverless Application Model
(AWS SAM). The developer is currently testing the application in a development environment. When
the application is nearly finsihed, the developer will need to set up additional testing and staging
environments for a quality assurance team.
The developer wants to use a feature of the AWS SAM to set up deployments to multiple
environments.
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST development effort?
A. Add a configuration file in TOML format to group configuration entries to every environment. Add
a table for each testing and staging environment. Deploy updates to the environments by using the
sam deploy command and the --config-env flag that corresponds to the each environment.
B. Create additional AWS SAM templates for each testing and staging environment. Write a custom
shell script that uses the sam deploy command and the --template-file flag to deploy updates to the
environments.
C. Create one AWS SAM configuration file that has default parameters. Perform updates to the
testing and staging environments by using the ”parameter-overrides flag in the AWS SAM CLI and
the parameters that the updates will override.
D. Use the existing AWS SAM template. Add additional parameters to configure specific attributes for
the serverless function and database table resources that are in each environment. Deploy updates
to the testing and staging environments by using the sam deploy command.
Answer: A
Explanation:
The correct answer is
A. Add a configuration file in TOML format to group configuration entries to
every environment. Add a table for each testing and staging environment. Deploy updates to the
environments by using the sam deploy command and the --config-env flag that corresponds to the
each environment.
A) Add a configuration file in TOML format to group configuration entries to every environment. Add
a table for each testing and staging environment. Deploy updates to the environments by using the
sam deploy command and the --config-env flag that corresponds to the each environment. This is
correct. This solution will meet the requirements with the least development effort, because it uses a
feature of the AWS SAM CLI that supports a project-level configuration file that can be used to
configure AWS SAM CLI command parameter values1. The configuration file can have multiple
environments, each with its own set of parameter values, such as stack name, region, capabilities,

and more2. The developer can use the --config-env option to specify which environment to use when
deploying the application3. This way, the developer can avoid creating multiple templates or scripts,
or manually overriding parameters for each environment.
B) Create additional AWS SAM templates for each testing and staging environment. Write a custom
shell script that uses the sam deploy command and the --template-file flag to deploy updates to the
environments. This is incorrect. This solution will not meet the requirements with the least
development effort, because it requires creating and maintaining multiple templates and scripts for
each environment. This can introduce duplication, inconsistency, and complexity in the deployment
process.
C) Create one AWS SAM configuration file that has default parameters. Perform updates to the
testing and staging environments by using the ”parameter-overrides flag in the AWS SAM CLI and
the parameters that the updates will override. This is incorrect. This solution will not meet the
requirements with the least development effort, because it requires manually specifying and
overriding parameters for each environment every time the developer deploys the application. This
can be error-prone, tedious, and inefficient.
D) Use the existing AWS SAM template. Add additional parameters to configure specific attributes for
the serverless function and database table resources that are in each environment. Deploy updates
to the testing and staging environments by using the sam deploy command. This is incorrect. This
solution will not meet the requirements with the least development effort, because it requires
modifying the existing template and adding complexity to the resource definitions for each
environment. This can also make it difficult to manage and track changes across different
environments.

QUESTION 141
A company notices that credentials that the company uses to connect to an external software as a
service (SaaS) vendor are stored in a configuration file as plaintext.
The developer needs to secure the API credentials and enforce automatic credentials rotation on a
quarterly basis.
Which solution will meet these requirements MOST securely?
A. Use AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) to encrypt the configuration file. Decrypt the
configuration file when users make API calls to the SaaS vendor. Enable rotation.
B. Retrieve temporary credentials from AWS Security Token Service (AWS STS) every 15 minutes. Use
the temporary credentials when users make API calls to the SaaS vendor.
C. Store the credentials in AWS Secrets Manager and enable rotation. Configure the API to have
Secrets Manager access.
D. Store the credentials in AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store and enable rotation. Retrieve the
credentials when users make API calls to the SaaS vendor.

Answer: C
Explanation:
Store the credentials in AWS Secrets Manager and enable rotation. Configure the API to have Secrets
Manager access. This is correct. This solution will meet the requirements most securely, because it
uses a service that is designed to store and manage secrets such as API credentials. AWS Secrets
Manager helps you protect access to your applications, services, and IT resources by enabling you to
rotate, manage, and retrieve secrets throughout their lifecycle1. You can store secrets such as
passwords, database strings, API keys, and license codes as encrypted values2. You can also configure
automatic rotation of your secrets on a schedule that you specify3. You can use the AWS SDK or CLI to
retrieve secrets from Secrets Manager when you need them4. This way, you can avoid storing
credentials in plaintext files or hardcoding them in your code.
QUESTION 142
A developer wants to deploy a new version of an AWS Elastic Beanstalk application. During
deployment, the application must maintain full capacity and avoid service interruption. Additionally,
the developer must minimize the cost of additional resources that support the deployment.
Which deployment method should the developer use to meet these requirements?
A. All at once
B. Rolling with additional batch
C. Blue/green
D. Immutable
Answer: D
Explanation:
The immutable deployment method is the best option for this scenario, because it meets the
requirements of maintaining full capacity, avoiding service interruption, and minimizing the cost of
additional resources.
The immutable deployment method creates a new set of instances in a separate Auto Scaling group
and deploys the new version of the application to them. Then, it swaps the new instances with the
old ones and terminates the old instances. This way, the application maintains full capacity during
the deployment and avoids any downtime. The cost of additional resources is also minimized,
because the new instances are only created for a short time and then replaced by the old ones.
The other deployment methods do not meet all the requirements:
The all at once method deploys the new version to all instances simultaneously, which causes a short
period of downtime and reduced capacity.
The rolling with additional batch method deploys the new version in batches, but for the first batch it
creates new instances instead of using the existing ones. This increases the cost of additional
resources and reduces the capacity of the original environment.

The blue/green method creates a new environment with a new set of instances and deploys the new
version to them. Then, it swaps the URLs between the old and new environments. This method
maintains full capacity and avoids service interruption, but it also increases the cost of additional
resources significantly, because it duplicates the entire environment.
QUESTION 143
A developer is building a serverless application by using AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS
SAM) on multiple AWS Lambda functions.
When the application is deployed, the developer wants to shift 10% of the traffic to the new
deployment of the application for the first 10 minutes after deployment. If there are no issues, all
traffic must switch over to the new version.
Which change to the AWS SAM template will meet these requirements?
A. Set the Deployment Preference Type to Canary10Percent10Minutes. Set the AutoPublishAlias
property to the Lambda alias.
B. Set the Deployment Preference Type to LinearlOPercentEvery10Minutes. Set AutoPubIishAIias
property to the Lambda alias.
C. Set the Deployment Preference Type to CanaryIOPercentIOMinutes. Set the PreTraffic and
PostTraffic properties to the Lambda alias.
D. Set the Deployment Preference Type to LinearlOPercentEveryIOMinutes. Set PreTraffic and Post
Traffic properties to the Lambda alias.
Answer: A
Explanation:
The AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) comes built-in with CodeDeploy to provide
gradual AWS Lambda deployments1. The DeploymentPreference property in AWS SAM allows you to
specify the type of deployment that you want. The Canary10Percent10Minutes option means that 10
percent of your customer traffic is immediately shifted to your new version. After 10 minutes, all
traffic is shifted to the new version1. The AutoPublishAlias property in AWS SAM allows AWS SAM to
automatically create an alias that points to the updated version of the Lambda function1. Therefore,
option A is correct.
QUESTION 144
A company developed an API application on AWS by using Amazon CloudFront, Amazon API
Gateway, and AWS Lambd
a. The API has a
minimum of four requests every second. A developer notices that many API users run the same
query by using the POST method. The developer
wants to cache the POST request to optimize the API resources.
Which solution will meet these requirements?

A. Configure the CloudFront cache. Update the application to return cached content based upon the
default request headers.
B. Override the cache method in the selected stage of API Gateway. Select the POST method.
C. Save the latest request response in Lambda /tmp directory. Update the Lambda function to check
the /tmp directory.
D. Save the latest request in AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store. Modify the Lambda function to
take the latest request response from Parameter Store.
Answer: B
Explanation:
Amazon API Gateway provides tools for creating and documenting web APIs that route HTTP
requests to Lambda functions2. You can secure access to your API with authentication and
authorization controls. Your APIs can serve traffic over the internet or can be accessible only within
your VPC2. You can override the cache method in the selected stage of API Gateway2. Therefore,
option B is correct.
QUESTION 145
A company is building a compute-intensive application that will run on a fleet of Amazon EC2
instances. The application uses attached Amazon
Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volumes for storing dat
a. The Amazon EBS volumes will be created at time of initial deployment. The
application will process sensitive information. All of the data must be encrypted. The solution should
not impact the application's performance.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A. Configure the fleet of EC2 instances to use encrypted EBS volumes to store data.
B. Configure the application to write all data to an encrypted Amazon S3 bucket.
C. Configure a custom encryption algorithm for the application that will encrypt and decrypt all data.
D. Configure an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) that has an encrypted root volume and store the data
to ephemeral disks.
Answer: A
Explanation:
Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) provides block level storage volumes for use with Amazon
EC2 instances1. Amazon EBS encryption offers a straight-forward encryption solution for your EBS
resources associated with your EC2 instances1. When you create an encrypted EBS volume and
attach it to a supported instance type, the following types of data are encrypted: Data at rest inside
the volume, all data moving between the volume and the instance, all snapshots created from the
volume, and all volumes created from those snapshots1. Therefore, option A is correct.

QUESTION 146
A developer is creating a new REST API by using Amazon API Gateway and AWS Lambd
a. The development team tests the API and validates responses for the known use cases before
deploying the API to the production environment.
The developer wants to make the REST API available for testing by using API Gateway locally.
Which AWS Serverless Application Model Command Line Interface (AWS SAM CLI) subcommand will
meet these requirements?
A. Sam local invoke
B. Sam local generate-event
C. Sam local start-lambda
D. Sam local start-api
Answer: D
Explanation:
The AWS Serverless Application Model Command Line Interface (AWS SAM CLI) is a command-line
tool for local development and testing of Serverless applications2. The sam local startapi
subcommand of AWS SAM CLI is used to simulate a REST API by starting a new local endpoint3.
Therefore, option D is correct.
QUESTION 147
A developer is creating an AWS Lambda function that consumes messages from an Amazon Simple
Queue Service (Amazon SQS) standard queue. The developer notices that the Lambda function
processes some messages multiple times.
How should developer resolve this issue MOST cost-effectively?
A. Change the Amazon SQS standard queue to an Amazon SQS FIFO queue by using the Amazon SQS
message deduplication ID.
B. Set up a dead-letter queue.
C. Set the maximum concurrency limit of the AWS Lambda function to 1
D. Change the message processing to use Amazon Kinesis Data Streams instead of Amazon SQS.
Answer: A
Explanation:
Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) is a fully managed queue service that allows you to decouple
and scale for applications1. Amazon SQS offers two types of queues: Standard and FIFO (First
In First Out) queues1. The FIFO queue uses the messageDeduplicationId property to treat messages
with the same value as duplicate2. Therefore, changing the Amazon SQS standard queue to an
Amazon SQS FIFO queue using the Amazon SQS message deduplication ID can help resolve the issue
of the Lambda function processing some messages multiple times. Therefore, option A is correct.

QUESTION 148
A developer has observed an increase in bugs in the AWS Lambda functions that a development
team has deployed in its Node.js application.
To minimize these bugs, the developer wants to implement automated testing of Lambda functions
in an environment that closely simulates the Lambda environment.
The developer needs to give other developers the ability to run the tests locally. The developer also
needs to integrate the tests into the team's continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD)
pipeline before the AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) deployment.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A. Create sample events based on the Lambda documentation. Create automated test scripts that
use the cdk local invoke command to invoke the Lambda functions. Check the response. Document
the test scripts for the other developers on the team. Update the CI/CD pipeline to run the test
scripts.
B. Install a unit testing framework that reproduces the Lambda execution environment. Create
sample events based on the Lambda documentation. Invoke the handler function by using a unit
testing framework. Check the response. Document how to run the unit testing framework for the
other developers on the team. Update the CI/CD pipeline to run the unit testing framework.
C. Install the AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) CLI tool. Use the sam local generateevent
command to generate sample events for the automated tests. Create automated test scripts
that use the sam local invoke command to invoke the Lambda functions. Check the response.
Document the test scripts for the other developers on the team. Update the CI/CD pipeline to run
the test scripts.
D. Create sample events based on the Lambda documentation. Create a Docker container from the
Node.js base image to invoke the Lambda functions. Check the response. Document how to run the
Docker container for the other developers on the team. Update the CllCD pipeline to run the Docker
container.
Answer: C
Explanation:
The AWS Serverless Application Model Command Line Interface (AWS SAM CLI) is a command-line
tool for local development and testing of Serverless applications3. The sam local generateevent
command of AWS SAM CLI generates sample events for automated tests3. The sam local
invoke command is used to invoke Lambda functions3. Therefore, option C is correct.
QUESTION 149
A developer wants to add request validation to a production environment Amazon API Gateway API.
The developer needs to test the changes
before the API is deployed to the production environment. For the test, the developer will send test
requests to the API through a testing tool.

Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?
A. Export the existing API to an OpenAPI file. Create a new API. Import the OpenAPI file. Modify the
new API to add request validation. Perform the tests. Modify the existing API to add request
validation. Deploy the existing API to production.
B. Modify the existing API to add request validation. Deploy the updated API to a new API Gateway
stage. Perform the tests. Deploy the updated API to the API Gateway production stage.
C. Create a new API. Add the necessary resources and methods, including new request validation.
Perform the tests. Modify the existing API to add request validation. Deploy the existing API to
production.
D. Clone the existing API. Modify the new API to add request validation. Perform the tests. Modify
the existing API to add request validation. Deploy the existing API to production.
Answer: B
Explanation:
Amazon API Gateway allows you to create, deploy, and manage a RESTful API to expose backend
HTTP endpoints, AWS Lambda functions, or other AWS services1. You can use API Gateway to
perform basic validation of an API request before proceeding with the integration request1. When
the validation fails, API Gateway immediately fails the request, returns a 400 error response to the
caller, and publishes the validation results in CloudWatch Logs1.
To test changes before deploying to a production environment, you can modify the existing API to
add request validation and deploy the updated API to a new API Gateway stage1. This allows you to
perform tests without affecting the production environment. Once testing is complete and
successful, you can then deploy the updated API to the API Gateway production stage1.
This approach has the least operational overhead as it avoids unnecessary creation of new APIs or
exporting and importing of APIs. It leverages the existing infrastructure and only requires changes in
the configuration of the existing API1.
QUESTION 150
A company has an existing application that has hardcoded database credentials A developer needs to
modify the existing application The application is deployed in two AWS Regions with an activepassive
failover configuration to meet companys disaster recovery strategy
The developer needs a solution to store the credentials outside the code. The solution must comply
With the company's disaster recovery strategy
Which solution Will meet these requirements in the MOST secure way?
A. Store the credentials in AWS Secrets Manager in the primary Region. Enable secret replication to
the secondary Region Update the application to use the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) based on the
Region.
B. Store credentials in AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store in the primary Region. Enable
parameter replication to the secondary Region. Update the application to use the Amazon Resource

Name (ARN) based on the Region.
C. Store credentials in a config file. Upload the config file to an S3 bucket in me primary Region.
Enable Cross-Region Replication (CRR) to an S3 bucket in the secondary region. Update the
application to access the config file from the S3 bucket based on the Region.
D. Store credentials in a config file. Upload the config file to an Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon
EFS) file system. Update the application to use the Amazon EFS file system Regional endpoints to
access the config file in the primary and secondary Regions.
Answer: A
Explanation:
AWS Secrets Manager is a service that allows you to store and manage secrets, such as database
credentials, API keys, and passwords, in a secure and centralized way. It also provides features such
as automatic secret rotation, auditing, and monitoring1. By using AWS Secrets Manager, you can
avoid hardcoding credentials in your code, which is a bad security practice and makes it difficult to
update them. You can also replicate your secrets to another Region, which is useful for disaster
recovery purposes2. To access your secrets from your application, you can use the ARN of the secret,
which is a unique identifier that includes the Region name. This way, your application can use the
appropriate secret based on the Region where it is deployed3.

QUESTION 151
A developer is creating an AWS Lambda function that searches for items from an Amazon DynamoDB
table that contains customer contact information- The DynamoDB table items have the customer's
email_address as the partition key and additional properties such as customer_type, name, and
job_tltle.
The Lambda function runs whenever a user types a new character into the customer_type text input
The developer wants the search to return partial matches of all the email_address property of a
particular customer_type The developer does not want to recreate the DynamoDB table.
What should the developer do to meet these requirements?
A. Add a global secondary index (GSI) to the DynamoDB table with customer_type as the partition
key and email_address as the sort key Perform a query operation on the GSI by using the
begvns_wth key condition expression With the emad_address property
B. Add a global secondary index (GSI) to the DynamoDB table With ernail_address as the partition
key and customer_type as the sort key Perform a query operation on the GSI by using the
begins_wtth key condition expression With the emal_address property.
C. Add a local secondary index (LSI) to the DynamoDB table With customer_type as the partition key
and email_address as the sort key Perform a query operation on the LSI by using the begins_wlth key

condition expression With the email_address property
D. Add a local secondary Index (LSI) to the DynamoDB table With job_tltle as the partition key and
emad_address as the sort key Perform a query operation on the LSI by using the begins_wrth key
condition expression With the email_address property
Answer: A
Explanation:
Understand the Problem: The existing DynamoDB table has email_address as the partition key.
Searching by customer_type requires a different data access pattern. We need an efficient way to
query for partial matches on email_address based on customer_type.
Why Global Secondary Index (GSI):
GSIs allow you to define a different partition key and sort key from the main table, enabling new
query patterns.
In this case, having customer_type as the GSI's partition key lets you group all emails with the same
customer type together.
Using email_address as the sort key allows ordering within each customer type, facilitating the
partial matching.
Querying the GSI:
You'll perform a query operation on the GSI, not the original table.
Use the begins_with key condition expression on the GSI's sort key (email_address) to find partial
matches as the user types in the customer_type field.

QUESTION 152
A developer is deploying a company's application to Amazon EC2 instances The application generates
gigabytes of data files each day The files are rarely accessed but the files must be available to the
application's users within minutes of a request during the first year of storage The company must
retain the files for 7 years.
How can the developer implement the application to meet these requirements MOST costeffectively?
A. Store the files in an Amazon S3 bucket Use the S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval storage class Create an
S3 Lifecycle policy to transition the files to the S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class after 1 year
B. Store the files in an Amazon S3 bucket. Use the S3 Standard storage class. Create an S3 Lifecycle
policy to transition the files to the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval storage class after 1 year.
C. Store the files on an Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume Use Amazon Data Lifecycle
Manager (Amazon DLM) to create snapshots of the EBS volumes and to store those snapshots in
Amazon S3

D. Store the files on an Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) mount. Configure EFS lifecycle
management to transition the files to the EFS Standard-Infrequent Access (Standard-IA) storage class
after 1 year.
Answer: A
Explanation:
Amazon S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval is an archive storage class that delivers the lowest-cost storage
for long-lived data that is rarely accessed and requires retrieval in milliseconds. With S3 Glacier
Instant Retrieval, you can save up to 68% on storage costs compared to using the S3 Standard-
Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) storage class, when your data is accessed once per quarter.
https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/glacier/instant-retrieval/
Understanding Storage Requirements:
Files are large and infrequently accessed, but need to be available within minutes when requested in
the first year.
Long-term (7-year) retention is required.
Cost-effectiveness is a top priority.
Why S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval:
Matches the retrieval requirements (access within minutes).
More cost-effective than S3 Standard for infrequently accessed data.
Simpler to use than traditional Glacier where retrievals take hours.
Why S3 Glacier Deep Archive:
Most cost-effective S3 storage class for long term archival.
Meets the 7-year retention requirement.
S3 Lifecycle Policy:
Automate the transition from Glacier Instant Retrieval to Glacier Deep Archive after one year.
Optimize costs by matching storage classes to access patterns.

QUESTION 153
A developer is creating a serverless application that uses an AWS Lambda function The developer
will use AWS CloudFormation to deploy the application The application will write logs to Amazon
CloudWatch Logs The developer has created a log group in a CloudFormation template for the
application to use The developer needs to modify the CloudFormation template to make the name
of the log group available to the application at runtime
Which solution will meet this requirement?

A. Use the AWS:lnclude transform in CloudFormation to provide the log group's name to the
application
B. Pass the log group's name to the application in the user data section of the CloudFormation
template.
C. Use the CloudFormation template's Mappings section to specify the log group's name for the
application.
D. Pass the log group's Amazon Resource Name (ARN) as an environment variable to the Lambda
function
Answer: D
Explanation:
CloudFormation and Lambda Environment Variables:
CloudFormation is an excellent tool to manage infrastructure as code, including the log group
resource.
Lambda functions can access environment variables at runtime, making them a suitable way to pass
configuration information like the log group ARN.
CloudFormation Template Modification:
In your CloudFormation template, define the log group resource.
In the Lambda function resource, add an Environment section:
YAML
Environment:
Variables:
LOG_GROUP_ARN: !Ref LogGroupResourceName
Use code with caution.
content_copy
The !Ref intrinsic function retrieves the log group's ARN, which CloudFormation generates during
stack creation.

QUESTION 154
A company has a web application that runs on Amazon EC2 instances with a custom Amazon
Machine Image (AMI) The company uses AWS CloudFormation to provision the application The
application runs in the us-east-1 Region, and the company needs to deploy the application to the uswest-

1 Region
An attempt to create the AWS CloudFormation stack in us-west-1 fails. An error message states that
the AMI ID does not exist. A developer must resolve this error with a solution that uses the least
amount of operational overhead
Which solution meets these requirements?
A. Change the AWS CloudFormation templates for us-east-1 and us-west-1 to use an AWS AMI.
Relaunch the stack for both Regions.
B. Copy the custom AMI from us-east-1 to us-west-1. Update the AWS CloudFormation template for
us-west-1 to refer to AMI ID for the copied AMI Relaunch the stack
C. Build the custom AMI in us-west-1 Create a new AWS CloudFormation template to launch the
stack in us-west-1 with the new AMI ID
D. Manually deploy the application outside AWS CloudFormation in us-west-1.
Answer: B
Explanation:
Problem: CloudFormation can't find the custom AMI in the target region (us-west-1) because AMIs
are region-specific.
Copying AMIs:
AMIs can be copied across regions, maintaining their configuration.
This approach minimizes operational overhead as the existing CloudFormation template can be
reused with a minor update.
Updating the Template:
Modify the CloudFormation template in us-west-1 to reference the newly copied AMI's ID in that
region.

QUESTION 155
A developer is working on a web application that uses Amazon DynamoDB as its data store The
application has two DynamoDB tables one table that is named artists and one table that is named
songs The artists table has artistName as the partition key. The songs table has songName as the
partition key and artistName as the sort key
The table usage patterns include the retrieval of multiple songs and artists in a single database
operation from the webpage. The developer needs a way to retrieve this information with minimal
network traffic and optimal application performance.
Which solution will meet these requirements'?
A. Perform a BatchGetltem operation that returns items from the two tables. Use the list of
songName artistName keys for the songs table and the list of artistName key for the artists table.

B. Create a local secondary index (LSI) on the songs table that uses artistName as the partition key
Perform a query operation for each artistName on the songs table that filters by the list of songName
Perform a query operation for each artistName on the artists table
C. Perform a BatchGetltem operation on the songs table that uses the songName/artistName keys.
Perform a BatchGetltem operation on the artists table that uses artistName as the key.
D. Perform a Scan operation on each table that filters by the list of songName/artistName for the
songs table and the list of artistName in the artists table.
Answer: A
Explanation:
Scenario: Application needs to fetch songs and artists efficiently in a single operation.
BatchGetItem: This DynamoDB operation retrieves multiple items across different tables based on
their primary keys in a single request.
Optimized for Request Batching: This approach reduces network traffic compared to performing
multiple queries individually.
Data Modeling: The songs table is designed appropriately for this access pattern using artistName as
the sort key.

QUESTION 157
A company's developer has deployed an application in AWS by using AWS CloudFormation The
CloudFormation stack includes parameters in AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store that the
application uses as configuration settings. The application can modify the parameter values
When the developer updated the stack to create additional resources with tags, the developer noted
that the parameter values were reset and that the values ignored the latest changes made by the
application. The developer needs to change the way the company deploys the CloudFormation stack.
The developer also needs to avoid resetting the parameter values outside the stack.
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST development effort?
A. Modify the CloudFormation stack to set the deletion policy to Retain for the Parameter Store
parameters.
B. Create an Amazon DynamoDB table as a resource in the CloudFormation stack to hold
configuration data for the application Migrate the parameters that the application is modifying from
Parameter Store to the DynamoDB table
C. Create an Amazon RDS DB instance as a resource in the CloudFormation stack. Create a table in the
database for parameter configuration. Migrate the parameters that the application is modifying from
Parameter Store to the configuration table
D. Modify the CloudFormation stack policy to deny updates on Parameter Store parameters
Answer: A
Explanation:
Problem: CloudFormation updates reset Parameter Store parameters, disrupting application
behavior.
Deletion Policy: CloudFormation has a deletion policy that controls resource behavior when a stack is
deleted or updated. The 'Retain' policy instructs CloudFormation to preserve a resource's current
state.
Least Development Effort: This solution involves a simple CloudFormation template modification,

requiring minimal code changes.

CloudTrail logs IAM role creation.
EventBridge rules can filter CloudTrail events and trigger SNS notifications instantly.
QUESTION 161
A developer is investigating an issue in part of a company's application. In the application messages
are sent to an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue The AWS Lambda function polls
messages from the SQS queue and sends email messages by using Amazon Simple Email Service
(Amazon SES) Users have been receiving duplicate email messages during periods of high traffic.
Which reasons could explain the duplicate email messages? (Select TWO.)
A. Standard SQS queues support at-least-once message delivery
B. Standard SQS queues support exactly-once processing, so the duplicate email messages are
because of user error.
C. Amazon SES has the DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) authentication incorrectly configured
D. The SQS queue's visibility timeout is lower than or the same as the Lambda function's timeout.
E. The Amazon SES bounce rate metric is too high.
Answer: A
Explanation:
SQS Delivery Behavior: Standard SQS queues guarantee at-least-once delivery, meaning messages
may be processed more than once. This can lead to duplicate emails in this scenario.
Visibility Timeout: If the visibility timeout on the SQS queue is too short, a message might become
visible for another consumer before the first Lambda function finishes processing it. This can also
lead to duplicates.

QUESTION 164
A developer designed an application on an Amazon EC2 instance The application makes API requests
to objects in an Amazon S3 bucket
Which combination of steps will ensure that the application makes the API requests in the MOST
secure manner? (Select TWO.)
A. Create an IAM user that has permissions to the S3 bucket. Add the user to an 1AM group
B. Create an IAM role that has permissions to the S3 bucket
C. Add the IAM role to an instance profile. Attach the instance profile to the EC2 instance.
D. Create an 1AM role that has permissions to the S3 bucket Assign the role to an 1AM group
E. Store the credentials of the IAM user in the environment variables on the EC2 instance
Answer: BC
Explanation:
IAM Roles for EC2: IAM roles are the recommended way to provide AWS credentials to applications
running on EC2 instances. Here's how this works:
You create an IAM role with the necessary permissions to access the target S3 bucket.
You create an instance profile and associate the IAM role with this profile.
When launching the EC2 instance, you attach this instance profile.
Temporary Security Credentials: When the application on the EC2 instance needs to access S3, it
doesn't directly use access keys. Instead, the AWS SDK running on the instance retrieves temporary
security credentials associated with the role. These are rotated automatically by AWS.

QUESTION 165
A developer is working on an ecommerce website The developer wants to review server logs without
logging in to each of the application servers individually. The website runs on multiple Amazon EC2
instances, is written in Python, and needs to be highly available
How can the developer update the application to meet these requirements with MINIMUM

changes?
A. Rewrite the application to be cloud native and to run on AWS Lambda, where the logs can be
reviewed in Amazon CloudWatch
B. Set up centralized logging by using Amazon OpenSearch Service, Logstash, and OpenSearch
Dashboards
C. Scale down the application to one larger EC2 instance where only one instance is recording logs
D. Install the unified Amazon CloudWatch agent on the EC2 instances Configure the agent to push the
application logs to CloudWatch
Answer: D
Explanation:
Centralized Logging Benefits: Centralized logging is essential for operational visibility in scalable
systems, especially those using multiple EC2 instances like our e-commerce website. CloudWatch
provides this capability, along with other monitoring features.
CloudWatch Agent: This is the best way to send custom application logs from EC2 instances to
CloudWatch. Here's the process:
Install the CloudWatch agent on each EC2 instance.
Configure the agent with a configuration file, specifying:
Which log files to collect.
The format in which to send logs to CloudWatch (e.g., JSON).
The specific CloudWatch Logs log group and log stream for these logs.
Viewing and Analyzing Logs: Once the agent is pushing logs, use the CloudWatch Logs console or API:
View and search the logs across all instances.
Set up alarms based on log events.
Use CloudWatch Logs Insights for sophisticated queries and analysis.

QUESTION 166
A company runs a batch processing application by using AWS Lambda functions and Amazon API
Gateway APIs with deployment stages for development, user acceptance testing and production A
development team needs to configure the APIs in the deployment stages to connect to third-party
service endpoints.
Which solution will meet this requirement?

A. Store the third-party service endpoints in Lambda layers that correspond to the stage
B. Store the third-party service endpoints in API Gateway stage variables that correspond to the stage
C. Encode the third-party service endpoints as query parameters in the API Gateway request URL.
D. Store the third-party service endpoint for each environment in AWS AppConfig
Answer: B
Explanation:
API Gateway Stage Variables: These are designed for configuring dynamic values for your APIs in
different deployment stages (dev, test, prod). Here's how to use them for third-party endpoints:
In the API Gateway console, access the "Stages" section of your API.
For each stage, create a stage variable named something like thirdPartyEndpoint.
Set the value of this variable to the actual endpoint URL for that specific environment.
When configuring API requests within your API Gateway method, reference this endpoint
using ${stageVariables.thirdPartyEndpoint}.
Why Stage Variables Excel Here:
Environment Isolation: This approach keeps the endpoint configuration specific to each deployment
stage, ensuring the right endpoints are used during development, testing, and production cycles.
Ease of Management: You manage the endpoints directly through the API Gateway console without
additional infrastructure.

QUESTION 171
A company runs an application on AWS The application uses an AWS Lambda function that is
configured with an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue called high priority queue as
the event source A developer is updating the Lambda function with another SQS queue called low
priority queue as the event source The Lambda function must always read up to 10 simultaneous
messages from the high priority queue before processing messages from low priority queue. The
Lambda function must be limited to 100 simultaneous invocations.
Which solution will meet these requirements'?
A. Set the event source mapping batch size to 10 for the high priority queue and to 90 for the low
priority queue
B. Set the delivery delay to 0 seconds for the high priority queue and to 10 seconds for the low
priority queue
C. Set the event source mapping maximum concurrency to 10 for the high priority queue and to 90
for the low priority queue
D. Set the event source mapping batch window to 10 for the high priority queue and to 90 for the low

priority queue
Answer: C
Explanation:
Lambda Concurrency: The 'maximum concurrency' setting in event source mappings controls the
maximum number of simultaneous invocations Lambda allows for that specific source.
Prioritizing Queues: Setting a lower maximum concurrency for the 'high priority queue' ensures it's
processed first while allowing more concurrent invocations from the 'low priority queue'.
Batching: Batch size settings affect the number of messages Lambda retrieves from a queue per
invocation, which is less relevant to the prioritization requirement.

QUESTION 182
A developer is using AWS Step Functions to automate a workflow The workflow defines each step as

an AWS Lambda function task The developer notices that runs of the Step Functions state machine
fail in the GetResource task with either an UlegalArgumentException error or a
TooManyRequestsException error
The developer wants the state machine to stop running when the state machine encounters an
UlegalArgumentException error. The state machine needs to retry the GetResource task one
additional time after 10 seconds if the state machine encounters a TooManyRequestsException error.
If the second attempt fails, the developer wants the state machine to stop running.
How can the developer implement the Lambda retry functionality without adding unnecessary
complexity to the state machine'?
A. Add a Delay task after the GetResource task. Add a catcher to the GetResource task. Configure the
catcher with an error type of TooManyRequestsException. Configure the next step to be the Delay
task Configure the Delay task to wait for an interval of 10 seconds Configure the next step to be the
GetResource task.
B. Add a catcher to the GetResource task Configure the catcher with an error type of
TooManyRequestsException. an interval of 10 seconds, and a maximum attempts value of 1.
Configure the next step to be the GetResource task.
C. Add a retrier to the GetResource task Configure the retrier with an error type of
TooManyRequestsException, an interval of 10 seconds, and a maximum attempts value of 1.
D. Duplicate the GetResource task Rename the new GetResource task to TryAgain Add a catcher to
the original GetResource task Configure the catcher with an error type of
TooManyRequestsException. Configure the next step to be TryAgain.
Answer: C
Explanation:
Step Functions Retriers: Retriers provide a built-in way to gracefully handle transient errors within
State Machines. Here's how to use them:
Directly attach a retrier to the problematic 'GetResource' task.
Configure the retrier:
ErrorEquals: Set this to ['TooManyRequestsException'] to target the specific error.
IntervalSeconds: Set to 10 for the desired retry delay.
MaxAttempts: Set to 1, as you want only one retry attempt.
Error Handling:
Upon 'TooManyRequestsException', the retrier triggers the task again after 10 seconds.
On a second failure, Step Functions moves to the next state or fails the workflow, as per your design.
'IllegalArgumentException' causes error propagation as intended.

QUESTION 183
An Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue serves as an event source for an AWS
Lambda function In the SQS queue, each item corresponds to a video file that the Lambda function
must convert to a smaller resolution The Lambda function is timing out on longer video files, but the
Lambda function's timeout is already configured to its maximum value
What should a developer do to avoid the timeouts without additional code changes'?
A. Increase the memory configuration of the Lambda function
B. Increase the visibility timeout on the SQS queue
C. Increase the instance size of the host that runs the Lambda function.
D. Use multi-threading for the conversion.
Answer: B
Explanation:
Visibility Timeout: When an SQS message is processed by a consumer (here, the Lambda function),
it's temporarily hidden from other consumers. Visibility timeout controls this duration.
How It Helps:
Increase the visibility timeout beyond the maximum processing time your Lambda might typically
take for long videos.
This prevents the message from reappearing in the queue while Lambda is still working, avoiding
premature timeouts.

An AWS Lambda function requires read access to an Amazon S3 bucket and requires read/write
access to an Amazon DynamoDB table The correct 1AM policy already exists
What is the MOST secure way to grant the Lambda function access to the S3 bucket and the
DynamoDB table?
A. Attach the existing 1AM policy to the Lambda function.
B. Create an 1AM role for the Lambda function Attach the existing 1AM policy to the role Attach the
role to the Lambda function
C. Create an 1AM user with programmatic access Attach the existing 1AM policy to the user. Add the
user access key ID and secret access key as environment variables in the Lambda function.
D. Add the AWS account root user access key ID and secret access key as encrypted environment
variables in the Lambda function
Answer: B
Explanation:
Principle of Least Privilege: Granting specific permissions through an IAM role is more secure than

directly attaching policies to a function or using root user credentials.
IAM Roles for Lambda: Designed to provide temporary credentials to Lambda functions, enhancing
security.
Reusability: The existing IAM policy ensures the correct S3 and DynamoDB access is granted.

QUESTION 197
A developer is designing a serverless application for a game in which users register and log in
through a web browser The application makes requests on behalf of users to a set of AWS Lambda
functions that run behind an Amazon API Gateway HTTP API
The developer needs to implement a solution to register and log in users on the application's sign-in
page. The solution must minimize operational overhead and must minimize ongoing management of user identities.
Which solution will meet these requirements'?
A. Create Amazon Cognito user pools for external social identity providers Configure 1AM roles for
the identity pools.
B. Program the sign-in page to create users' 1AM groups with the 1AM roles attached to the groups
C. Create an Amazon RDS for SQL Server DB instance to store the users and manage the permissions
to the backend resources in AWS
D. Configure the sign-in page to register and store the users and their passwords in an Amazon
DynamoDB table with an attached IAM policy.
Answer: A
Explanation:
Amazon Cognito User Pools: A managed user directory service, simplifying user registration and
login.
Social Identity Providers: Cognito supports integration with external providers (e.g., Google,
Facebook), reducing development effort.
IAM Roles for Authorization: Cognito-managed IAM roles grant fine-grained access to AWS resources
(like Lambda functions).
Operational Overhead: Cognito minimizes the need to manage user identities and credentials
independently.

QUESTION 198
A developer supports an application that accesses data in an Amazon DynamoDB table. One of the
item attributes is expirationDate in the timestamp format. The application uses this attribute to find
items, archive them, and remove them from the table based on the timestamp value
The application will be decommissioned soon, and the developer must find another way to
implement this functionality. The developer needs a solution that will require the least amount of
code to write.
Which solution will meet these requirements?
A. Enable TTL on the expirationDate attribute in the table. Create a DynamoDB stream. Create an
AWS Lambda function to process the deleted items. Create a DynamoDB trigger for the Lambda
function.
B. Create two AWS Lambda functions one to delete the items and one to process the items Create a
DynamoDB stream Use the Deleteltem API operation to delete the items based on the
expirationDate attribute Use the GetRecords API operation to get the items from the DynamoDB
stream and process them
C. Create two AWS Lambda functions, one to delete the items and one to process the items. Create
an Amazon EventBndge scheduled rule to invoke the Lambda Functions Use the Deleteltem API
operation to delete the items based on the expirationDate attribute. Use the GetRecords API
operation to get the items from the DynamoDB table and process them.
D. Enable TTL on the expirationDate attribute in the table Specify an Amazon Simple Queue Service
(Amazon SQS> dead-letter queue as the target to delete the items Create an AWS Lambda function
to process the items
Answer: A
Explanation:
TTL for Automatic Deletion: DynamoDB's Time-to-Live effortlessly deletes expired items without
manual intervention.
DynamoDB Stream: Captures changes to the table, including deletions of expired items, triggering
downstream actions.
Lambda for Processing: A Lambda function connected to the stream provides custom logic for
handling the deleted items.
Code Efficiency: This solution leverages native DynamoDB features and stream-based processing,
minimizing the need for custom code.
